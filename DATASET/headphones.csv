0,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

5,11 May 2019,Kashif,"Good earphones i bought this earphone 2nd time its really a bass heads have good heavy bass so lets start its full review
Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

6,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

*Sturdy TPE material that provides ruggedness and durability
*PREMIUM metallic finish
*Tangle free and anxiety resistant cables.
*Integrated controls with a mic.",4.0 out of 5 stars
8,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
9,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.

May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.

30,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

58,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
59,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.

Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.

I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.

May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.

80,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

100,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

105,11 May 2019,Kashif,"Good earphones i bought this earphone 2nd time its really a bass heads have good heavy bass so lets start its full review
Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

106,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

108,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
109,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.

All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.

129,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
130,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------

Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.

And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.

150,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

156,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:

158,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
159,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.

● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.

179,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
180,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.

200,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes.

CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

228,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
229,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
230,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.

250,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

278,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
279,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
280,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.

Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake
I prefer this earphones at the range of 500rs its really worth buying
Writing this review 2nd time for your help guys
It deserves 4star

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes.

Better pricing of all.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.

299,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
300,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

320,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

326,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

328,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
329,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
350,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

370,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

375,11 May 2019,Kashif,"Good earphones i bought this earphone 2nd time its really a bass heads have good heavy bass so lets start its full review
Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

It deserves 4star

376,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

378,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
379,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.

All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.

399,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
400,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------

Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.

Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.

420,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free

426,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:

428,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
429,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.

● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.

449,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
450,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.

But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.

470,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes.

CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

498,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
499,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
500,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.

520,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

548,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
549,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
550,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.

Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake
I prefer this earphones at the range of 500rs its really worth buying
Writing this review 2nd time for your help guys
It deserves 4star

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes.

Better Sound quality than it's competitors

Better pricing of all.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.

569,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
570,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

590,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

596,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

598,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
599,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
620,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

640,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

645,11 May 2019,Kashif,"Good earphones i bought this earphone 2nd time its really a bass heads have good heavy bass so lets start its full review
Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

646,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

648,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
649,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.

All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.

669,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
670,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------

Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.

Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.

690,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free

696,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:

698,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
699,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.

● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.

719,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
720,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.

I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.

740,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes.

CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

768,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
769,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
770,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.

But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.

790,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

818,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
819,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
820,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.

Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake
I prefer this earphones at the range of 500rs its really worth buying
Writing this review 2nd time for your help guys
It deserves 4star

I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Better Sound quality than it's competitors

Better pricing of all.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.

839,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
840,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

860,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

866,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

868,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
869,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
890,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

910,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

916,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

918,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
919,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.

All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.

939,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.
Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.
And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
940,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------

Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.

960,30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars
961,17 October 2017,Sumit More,I had purchased these boat headphones on may 2017. Suddenly it has stopped working after just 4 months. It has a warrenty of 1 year.

965,11 May 2019,Kashif,"Good earphones i bought this earphone 2nd time its really a bass heads have good heavy bass so lets start its full review
Its bass is so good
Its sound quality is fine not that much good as per its price it is good but at full volume due to high bass it becomes little noicey
Its forest green colour which i bought is so bad looking it looks like so local earphones but are really good
Its built quality is awesome it have metal body and feels little heavy in ears.
They are also really tangel free
Now why 3star because i didn't received earphones my box was empty but i got my full refund not a seller mistake

966,14 September 2018,vijay,"The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.

Pros:
Better Sound quality than it's competitors
Built quality is great (metal finish)
Better Noise cancellation than it's rivals
Bass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)
Better pricing of all.

Cons:
Nothing as of now",5.0 out of 5 stars

968,23 September 2018,Abhinandan A S,"One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.
Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.
Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.
Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.
I want to give 0 stars for this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
969,2 November 2018,Vineet Thakur,"Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.
Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
