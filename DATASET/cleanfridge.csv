20 October 2017,Suresh Kumar,I am using this since a week..for every 10-20 mins it gives sound like small ballon blast..no replacement option.. Contacted SAMSUNG customer service agent visited to check the performance. They said it's a default problem in single door refrigerator..is it so??? Is anyone of you facing the same problem?,1.0 out of 5 stars
21 November 2018,Amazon Customer,Very super . Refrigerator as I am expected.. Good from Samsung ... Amazon amazing delivery within 8 hours of order placed never expected delivery high speed... Somewhat heating on sides of refrigerator but it's not complaint it's moisture evaporation... Highly recommended to buy... Love Samsung and Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars
23 September 2018,Biswajeet Rana,"The fridge is good and also saves power and friendly on monthly e-bill, looks neat and also is spacious but one big user-unfriendliness is that after defrost, the water storage container is not easily removable! This is pretty strange as even 20 years old Alwyn fridges or Videocon ones have it simple and detachable. The water dispenser is actually fixed with 2 screws and one has to open it everytime. It is a pain.",2.0 out of 5 stars
5 September 2018,Gunjan Pandey,"I bought this product from Amazon, fridge was working well but after 3 months it stop working .I complain service engineer visit and after knowing I bought it online . service centre is saying it's due to physical damage. And I have to pay 8000..

If it's like that why we purchase online product..",1.0 out of 5 stars
18 August 2018,Amazon Customer,"Very pleased with it. Its really light with suprisingly low power rating (60W). In fact so light that with the strong door seal when you open the fridge the whole thing moves. That could also be because its not on firm ground yet so i'm not taking away any stars. The reason for two less stars is because of Samsung customer care (i had a chat with product expert on website), who refused to provide any info on this model thats not listed on their site. Even refused to acknowledge its existence! Regardless, I recommend this fridge for extremely high efficiency - only 198 units / yr and its ability to function on inverter.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Dislike:- aapka freeze ki delivery dene aaya Banda sadak par hi freeze patak kar jaane lag rha tha. Aur sirf 1st floor par ghar me rakhwane se mujhe mna kr rha tha. Jab ki aapke offer me installation tak ka charge mujhse already Liya ja Chuka tha. Fir Baad me bahas k Baad me rakhwaya gya.",3.0 out of 5 stars

18 August 2018,Amazon Customer,"Very pleased with it. Its really light with suprisingly low power rating (60W). In fact so light that with the strong door seal when you open the fridge the whole thing moves. That could also be because its not on firm ground yet so i'm not taking away any stars. The reason for two less stars is because of Samsung customer care (i had a chat with product expert on website), who refused to provide any info on this model thats not listed on their site. Even refused to acknowledge its existence! Regardless, I recommend this fridge for extremely high efficiency - only 198 units / yr and its ability to function on inverter.",3.0 out of 5 stars

18 August 2018,Amazon Customer,"Very pleased with it. Its really light with suprisingly low power rating (60W). In fact so light that with the strong door seal when you open the fridge the whole thing moves. That could also be because its not on firm ground yet so i'm not taking away any stars. The reason for two less stars is because of Samsung customer care (i had a chat with product expert on website), who refused to provide any info on this model thats not listed on their site. Even refused to acknowledge its existence! Regardless, I recommend this fridge for extremely high efficiency - only 198 units / yr and its ability to function on inverter.",3.0 out of 5 stars

18 August 2018,Amazon Customer,"Very pleased with it. Its really light with suprisingly low power rating (60W). In fact so light that with the strong door seal when you open the fridge the whole thing moves. That could also be because its not on firm ground yet so i'm not taking away any stars. The reason for two less stars is because of Samsung customer care (i had a chat with product expert on website), who refused to provide any info on this model thats not listed on their site. Even refused to acknowledge its existence! Regardless, I recommend this fridge for extremely high efficiency - only 198 units / yr and its ability to function on inverter.",3.0 out of 5 stars
