0,23 June 2019,Nishant Lala,"READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.

Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.

*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)

*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.

*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.

*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).

*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).

*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.

DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.

*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.

PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.

GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works great

SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.

STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.

SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.

LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.

It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)

In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.

The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.

BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.

It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.

Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-

PROS—

1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.

2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.

3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.

4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).

5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.

6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.

7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.

8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.

9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.

10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.

11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.

12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).

13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.

14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.

15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.

16) There are many launch offers from many operators.

Cons—

1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.

2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.

3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.

VERDICT—

If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.

Thank you for reading my review.

1,22 June 2019,NK,"I got this phone as a gift. I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.

But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.

Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?

User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!"
2,21 June 2019,Arnav rathour,"I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece."
3,The manufacturer commented on the review below,nikhil bhanushali,"Plz avoid buying ....
1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly..."
4,10 July 2019,Genuine Reviewer ✓®,"So, today i am reviewing on this new phone. I am using this phone from last 4-5 days.

The Samsung Galaxy M40 offers a refined design as compared to the other M-series smartphones from the company. It is quite compact despite bearing a 6.3-inch screen and lightweight to hold. The back comes with a gradient finish with edges reflecting the light blue colour, while the center is dark. This surely gives a premium look and feel to the device, which is particularly absent in other Galaxy M smartphones. This smartphone from Samsung comes loaded with Infinity-O display, which is present in the company’s flagship series.

Now comes to its review

For Gamers:

If you are gamer then this one is best phone i play Pubg too much that works too smooth without any lags. this one is great on this phone

Coming to camera: that primary camera comes with 32-megapixel camera and front camera comes with 16-megapixel camera. while videocall and selfies that gives best pictures. in day light the quality of camera is awesome. This phone delivers best photos when the lights are present in ample amount. The 5-megapixel depth sensor also does a good job here. This coupled with Live Focus delivers a good photo in daylight conditions and it looks quite natural in nature.

Looks wise:
Now comes to looks, looks wise this is amazing. i just love the look of this phone from backside that is really an amazing.

Battery:
Battery wise i just want to tell that this phone is just a beast that comes with fast charging. Battery life is good if you are using that phone normally. i like the battery backup of this.

They gave type c port earphones that is really nice. sound quality is really amazing

Cons:

Till now i didn’t found any cons in this will update review if i found any issue in that. just one little issue which i fount till now that is you can’t hold your phone single handed that was too slippery in back if you hold that single handed.

22,21 June 2019,🛡️ Captain Retail 🛡️ 📷 #captain_retail," DISPLAY
=======
👍 Infinity display similar to the Galaxy S10 now in M40 }-- Looks like the more expensive Galaxy S10e display
👍 6.3” size, with 91.8% screen to body ratio }-- very thin bezels on top and sides
👍 PLS LCD display Samsung's proprietary technology }-- Wish it had AMOLED, but PLS LCD offers better viewing angles and higher max brightness
👍 Full HD+ resolution 1080x2340 ~409ppi }-- Wide vine L1 certified, runs Amazon Prime videos in true HD
👍 Punch Hole notch }-- for me this looks better than regular notches, wallpapers are there to hide the notch ;)

PROCESSOR & GPU
================
👍 Snapdragon 675 Octa-core (2x2.0 GHz Kryo 460 Gold & 6x1.7 GHz Kryo 460 Silver) }-- The latest 6xx series snapdragon processor
👍 11nm processor }-- low power usage, battery lasting longer
👍 Adreno 612 GPU }-- PUBG runs smoothly in HD graphics with High Frame Rate, Asphalt 9 also runs without any lags and is smooth.

STORAGE & RAM
===============
👍 6 GB RAM }-- no lags in multitasking, was able to run several application and switch between them with ease
👍 128 GB Storage
🆗  Expandable storage }-- I was able to use the hybrid sim slot for SD card

PROTECTION
===========
👍  Corning Gorilla Glass protection for display }-- not sure on the version though
👎🏻  No IP rating }-- honestly I don't expect a mid-ranger to have IP certifications
👍 SAR value 0.200 W/Kg }-- not much radiation, do it's better than brands like Xiaomi

BATTERY & CHARGING
===================
👍  3500 mAh Li-Po battery }-- 1 day battery life with normal usage. Can get 5 hours of on-screen time on heavy usage with videos, gaming and mobile data with sync which is very good. Battery optimization is very good.
👍  15W charging }-- it just took ~36 minutes to charge from 0% to 50%, but 50% to 100% might take a bit longer.

CAMERA
=======
👍 Triple Rear Camera setup }-- An upgraded and better camera from M30, expecting software updates for better post processing. Current software processing is okay but can be improved as the camera hardware is a good one.
👍 32 MP, f/1.7 with PDAF }-- Good day light shots and low light photos were a hit and miss, it's good for this segment but can improve. Am hoping the software updates from Samsung for the camera should make this a lot better and the best in the segment, waiting for them.
👍 8MP, f/2.2, 12mm Ultrawide Camera }-- Able to cover a wide area around 123 degree field of view.
👍 5MP depth sensor camera }-- edge detection was good in portrait shots.
👍 Super Slow motion and Slow motion }-- the super slow-mo videos are superb
👍 4K video recording
👍 16MP Front Camera }-- Selfies were very good in daylight. The beautify mode is good. Waiting for more updates on the camera post-processing. But this is same as pictures taken from A50 which has a 25MP camera.

SOFTWARE & NETWORK
=====================
👍  ONE UI 1.1 on top of Android 9.0 (Pie) }-- lots of features, simpler, smoother and very clean interface
👍  Not much bloatware or no Ads like the Xiaomi's Redmi.
👍  Very good Battery optimization, but still can be improved. Expecting updates to further enhance.
👍  Has all Indian Bands covered with dual VoLTE.

OTHER FEATURES
===============
🆗 No 3.5 mm headphone jack }-- Only type C earphones can be used or need to use Type-C to 3.5mm adapter but most phones in future will move to Type C earphones
👍 Type C earphones provided along with the phone }-- thanks for the earphones
👍  On Screen Sound }-- The entire display is the speaker, so while taking call I was able to hear the other person by placing my ear on any part of the display. No worries about earpiece grill and dust. Keep ear on the screen. First time it might take some time to adjust, but soon you might start liking this as you don't need to keep the ear at a specific place.
👍  Support Dolby Atmos }-- Very good quality sound from bottom firing speakers, and screen doubles as a speaker too.
👍  Rear Finger print reader }-- placed in a good position reachable by the finger and is fast.
🆗 No infrared remote, not a deal breaker for me.
👍  Bluetooth version 5.0 with A2DP, LE.
🆗 Dual tone colored but 2 color options only }-- I wish there was a red, white and black variant.
👍 The phone is just 7.9mm and weighs 168grams. It easy to hold and grip.

OVERALL - WORTHY BUY
========  :::::::::::::::::::::
>> When considering this price segment, the Samsung M40 seems to be the best all rounder.
>> Hoping that the the software updates can make the capable camera hardware to do best job and also enhance battery, though am satisfied with the current performance. You can check the pictures i took with the M40 on a gloomy day where sunlight was less.

👌🏼 The latest 675 processor, On Screen Sound technology, Dolby Atmos sound, Type C with earphones in the box, triple camera setup, super slow motion, 6GB RAM for multitasking, 128GB on board storage with expandable storage and within Rs.20000 makes this the best budget All-Rounder phone from Samsung.
👉 Amazon giving the phone as exclusive and with offers from all major carriers makes is a good move.
👌🏼 PUBG and Asphalt runs smooth with HD and High settings makes me happy with the buy. Good to have Snapdragon in the M series.

Overall a great budget phone within 20k, the Infinity O Display looks so cool and it looks like a S10e. Though the current display looks very good especially with punch hole notch, I wish the display was AMOLED. And also wish there was a red or white variant and maybe a metallic finish. The phone has touched all areas with a good score."
23,The manufacturer commented on the review below,satish,Worst experience battery drains fast...many applications not supported ...voice clearty very bad....
24,21 June 2019,Devendra,"Please dont buy it.
The main issue is battery. Its heating after taking 2-3 pics, also draining very fast.
I have seen it first day and want to change with other model, but they didn't help with that. So please choose other option. Its not worthy to money."
25,22 June 2019,Jayaprakash,"Phone looks good in camera, touch, performance, battery performance is poor with 3500mah and on screen speaker vibrates a lot and bad voice clarity... Music with Dolby Atmos it's great."
26,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Jothimani S,"Camera quality very worst and pathetic.
Battery life average only and draining fast
Display quality looks like 5k smartphone
Low sound effects
Vibration in screen during calls and it is not clear
Totally disappointed with M40 and want to throw back in dustbin."
27,The manufacturer commented on the review below,mohammad yasir,Don’t purchase it’s was of money
28,21 June 2019,ramkumar26,Good
29,21 June 2019,naresh,Looks stunning... Performance is good.. One UI is awesome. But need to improve the in screen sound technology..
30,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ghanshyam Pandey,"Camera Quality is really bad , feels like a device from 2019 has a camera quality of 2015.
The Device started to heat in just 15-30 minutes of Video call on Whatsapp.
Previously I used to use
Redmi note 5 pro but I have never faced any heating issue that too In a Xiomi Device.And Hell lot of Bugs .
Voice call quality is not good enough , you will feel the vibrations on your ears which makes it really difficult to understand a simple conversation.
Battery drains drastically.
Some features does not respond as expected.
Expecting Samsung India to come up with proper updates.
I tried to replace this device with some other phone or asking for the refund ,but the customer care provides me with policy change bullshit, though we have an option for replace or refund option in the Amazon App.
I scheduled a technician check up with the customer care on 27.06.2019 but it was rescheduled to 28.06.2019 without the concern of the user.
Amazon India has been really degrading their status and customer service and new policies now after being the No.1 Internet BRAND in India"
31,The manufacturer commented on the review below,dhiraj,"not at all as expected
battery (4000mah) finished from morning 10 30 to evening 7 pm
had to charge again
my old A5 2017 (3000mah) lasted all day
and charger cord is third grade less than a meter
and thin like a cheap Rs 50 cord"
32,21 June 2019,Madhu Sudhan,"The voice clarity is not being reproduced well and even in slightly noisy environment its difficult to converse without asking the person on other side to repeat a few times.

Battery doesn't last even a day"
33,21 June 2019,Himanshu,"Lookwise and Operation wise superb phone.. Operates smoothly with sanpdragon.. Display is awesome specially with lighting around front camera... holding in hand gives super premium feeling.. I didn't like the camera quality at all.. bokeh effect pathetic even in full day light... low light photgraphy at night not upto the mark... Except camera outstanding phone...

After 7 days of use... Notification a big problem. You can't even turn off.. I get some useless notification 3-4 times in a day and there is no option to turn off.. Can Samsung Justify why you don't give option to turn off???"
34,The manufacturer commented on the review below,suresh kumar,"Battery and camera not effective as described by Amazon,both Samsung and Amazon make peoples fool"
35,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Harikrishna Thammineni,"Plz avoid buying ....
1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...

My suggestion is Company has to recall all these phones, or else it impact on entire brand. All users facing issues mainly call, if it's basic functionality of the call voice not working, keeping the is waste.. samsung has to recall the phone and repay the money, if not repaying the money to users it impacts entire Samsung brand, users never buy the mobiles in Amazon."
36,22 June 2019,Ashish Kumar Dubey,Phone is good but camera not good don't buy this phone
37,21 June 2019,PARIKSHITkhade,Mobile gets too hot while playing pubg. Front camera is not good. Pubg not works properly in balanced graphics. Don't buy this if you play pubg waste of money
38,22 June 2019,Amit kumar tripathi,"This is the worst phone in my life.There is nothing to like in it. Everything is going to dislike.
Some important thing for dislike.:-
1. Battery life only 5 to 6 hours
2.heating problem(You can not talk continuously)
3. Screen sound is very worst things

There are many more dislikes that, we do not have any time to explain it."
39,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Syed Y.,"Pros :
Camera is good .
Both selfie and rear cam.

Cons :
Fast charging doesn't help.
Fast charging takes more time .doesn't look like fast charging.
Too much of heating issues.
For this spec, atleat 4500 mah battery would be required.

Yet to install games like clash royals n pubg

Hope to have further updates"

44,21 June 2019,Hari,Excellent. I like this phone. Only the one thing is the audio Jack is missing it may be revolution for the type-c cable. Super slow motion camera is super and fingerprint response is so fast as light.
45,21 June 2019,Ved Prakash,"Initial Review - Phone look very nice, lightweight, finger sensors are very fast to recognise, phone is working very smooth and fast. Charging is good too.

Cons
- Picture quality is not upto the mark from Camera, it's not crisp looks smudged which is Trend in most Android phones I think, but good enough, Wide angle works nicely.
- It works on Indian Sim only, which is a big drawback for me, may be not for others.

Will update more review while I use the phone."

51,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Customer from Pune,"SIM tray not opening, without SIM it is everything but a phone.
So called ""On screen"" speaker is pathetic. Sound quality used to be much better in earlier mobiles.
Camera is average. You might say that for this price don't expect more than this. But then why triple camera. Even single camera would have given if not better then same results."
52,21 June 2019,Deepak,M40 Mobile is awesome. I have usee iphone 6 and 7 and moto g5s plus. As compare to those phone M40 is better in look and quality. Plastic uses for phone is good and its dual Volte means we can use two JIO sims at same time. 32MP camera is decent. Selfie camera is also good. Battery also perform good. Screen of phone should be little wide needes. I ordered and got seawater color whoc is a different color and looks ao nice. Its sceen is working as earpiece speaker means they have not given and mesh for listening its screen is working like ear speaker. You can listen the voice of other person from screen from holding phone from middle or below. Whole screen is working like speaker.

On calling Amazon I was enlightened that the guy attending to my call is the final authority and that I can't put me.on to anybody higher up.( this is on record). He suggested that they merely sell products and any defect is not their responsibility. He offered a solution that a technician will visit me 5 days later check the device and then draw up a story, post that they may replace the product. And beware there is no refund. Such pathetic service, they are taking us for a royal ride. He went on to say that they only promote products and give two hoots of what quality that product is off. So anybody who bought this..your problemo, you have been conned."
71,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Dhruvit Panchal,Please don't buy this phone because face lock very slow and front camera so so.

The screen sound technology is not so good. I have purchased the product after watching so many review from youtube but they may be paid reviews. Disappointed with the phone.
74,25 June 2019,Dennis James,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy M40 after careful deliberation and research. I wanted the latest cutting edge features and best configuration possible in my restricted budget of 20K. Below are my detailed observations regarding the features that make the Samsung M40 stand head and shoulders above any similar phone in the same price bracket. Many of these features were earlier only available on flagship phones at twice the cost and I feel Samsung has aggressively and effectively shattered the glass ceiling on budget phones with the premium feature packed M40. I will also try to provide detailed insight and my practical first hand experience with the M40's features while using it. I hope it helps you in getting a comprehensive in-depth understanding of the features.

Looks, Feel and Functionality:

● Infinity-O Display : M40 is the first Smart phone in this price range to feature the Infinity-O display which was only available in the flagship S10 series till now. This feature enables an expanded screen size with a screen-to-body ratio greater than 91% with FHD+ resolution by minimising the bezel even further, thereby providing a larger screen size without actually increasing the size of the phone. In fact the M40 has the thinnest bezel in the Galaxy M range. The uninterrupted mesmerising edge-to-edge experience actually makes the display look bigger than the phone you're holding in your hand.

● Punch hole front camera : The infinity-O display provides the solution to create a cut-out in the upper corner in which the Selfie camera is discreetly tucked away, accurately placed while maximising screen real estate and maintaining the larger screen-to-body ration with the minuscule almost-bezel-less display. This is not distracting at all unlike the previous in-your face notch in the center and I felt it is really a great unobtrusive placement which lets you forget it's there till you use the front-cam. Again this punch hole design was previously featured on the S10 series and till now was a flagship phone feature.

● Qualcomm 6xx series 2Ghz Octa-Core Snapdragon 675 with Adreno 612 GPU : This is the first M series phone featuring this latest 6xx Qualcomm 675 Snapdragon processor which has previously only been used in flagship phones. Simply put this processor super-powers the M40 for smooth, reliable and steady performance. It makes the M40 blistering fast with negligible app load times and allows brisk multi-tasking with numerous app loaded without any lag or delays. I felt the entire usage experience breezy, swift and snappy. The Adreno 612 GPU in combination with the processor handles the most graphics-intensive games comfortable without any slowdown or jitters that I could notice in games like Pubg and Asphalt 9 with its default setting of HD and High frame rate.

● Triple Rear Camera Setup: The Samsung M40 comes with the best and latest in class combination on its cameras. The triple camera combination is more advanced than the M30 with its 32 MP primary lens which clicks pictures in really great clarity and detail and its f/1.7 aperture offers flexibility to get good shots in low light. It also features a 5 MP depth sensor with f/2.2 aperture for amazing portrait snaps and I've takes some of the most vivid pictures of my daughters with the M40 already. It also features an 8 MP ultra wide-angle lens with f/2.2 with 123 degree field of view for excellent reproduction while capturing landscape shots. The front camera is a huge 16 mp Selfie and video calling camera with vibrant results and the above combination is a first for the Samsung M series. The camera also features Slow Motion, Ultra Slow Motion, Hyper Lapse and video recording at the industry latest 4K quality. The M40 also features an AI based scene optimiser which gives outstanding results and sublimely attractive photographs. Focus locks quite fast and daylight shots are crisp and vibrant with colours quite close to real life optics.

● Wide vine L1 and Dolby Atmos : One of the most under rated but beneficial feature in this time and age of online streaming is the strangely unknown Wide vine L1 certification that the Samsung M40 has. It is one of the rare phones which is certified and will stream popular streaming videos from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google play in true HD quality. Most phones do not feature or advertise this and simply provide non-hd content even on their HD or 4K supported phones. Definite plus for me as I spend a lot of time streaming movies and binging on show and find the true-HD experience awesome. Dolby Atmos brings cinema quality surround sound and was previously engineered on Flagship phones and increases the audio/visual experience even for gaming.

● On Screen sound technology : The M40 introduces the ground breaking futuristic On-Screen sound technology in the M40. The speaker is placed below the display effectively turning the entire display into a virtual speaker. This provides the benefit of saving speaker space thereby increasing the screen size and reducing the bezel further. The phone still needs to be placed in the normal position on the ear for best results and calling is crisp and clear in my experience when done so. This also translates into no speaker slot and grill to get clogged or damaged owing to daily use which is a nifty advantage for me.

● Android Pie and OneUi : This is the first Samsung Device which features latest version Android Pie pre-installed ready to use right out of the box. The M40 runs on the OneUI which is Samsung's custom software based on the android 9.0 Pie update. The user interface comes loaded with a minimalistic design which is optimised for a smooth and simple user experience with tons of customisations that can be done. There is a system wide Night Mode, support for dual messenger and some nifty gesture based navigation controls and the UI really makes one-handed usage easier. Pre-installed apps can be uninstalled but most are useful.

More Highlights, Features and Functionalities :

● The Samsung M40 has a 6.3 inches FHD+ capacitive touchscreen with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.
● At 7.9mm thickness combined with 168 gms weight in hand it is really lightweight and ergonomically designed.
● Featuring 6 GB ram with 128 GB storage capacity expandable to 512 GB it takes care of all your speed and storage requirements.
● Features Dual Hybrid sim slots for flexibility. Allows you to use 2 sim cards simultaneously or to expand storage using SD Card.
● Has 3500mah optimised Lithium-ion battery which easily give you a day's backup with around 20% left at the end of the day if you have heavy usage like me or a day and a half's backup if you have moderate usage.
● Good anti-glare visibility under sunlight owing to its 480 Nits brightness.
● Incorporates facial recognition for unlocking along with fingerprint scanner built into the back which is snappy and fast.
● Other sensors available on the M40 include Accelerometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Hall Sensor, Proximity Sensor and Virtual Light Sensing.
● The M40 Comes with a 15W fast charger which takes around 1.5 hours to charge phone to full.
● The M40 does away with the 3.5mm headphone slot and provides the future ready slimmer Type C earphones in box. The provided high quality earphones have crystal clear and crisp output and provide good immersive music experience.
● The M40 has had a bundled launch with loads of network offers which you can benefit from, including savings of 3110/- on Jio Galaxy Club with its double data offer, or get 100% more data upto 840 GB for 10 months on Airtel or Vodafone Cashback worth 3750/- on 50 recharge vouchers of 75/- each along with 250 GB data with additional 0.5 data for upto 18 months.
● The Company provides 1 year manufacturer warranty for phone and 6 months warranty for accessories in box from date of purchase.

Downsides:

● Samsung could have tried to squeeze in a bigger battery and it could have been a phone lasting 2 days.
● There should be more colour options even in metallic finishes or a size variant.
● Really need more options for protective accessories.
● Samsung could have worked on IPS certification and made the phone waterproof.

The Samsung M40 is a beautifully crafted mobile which looks both premium and elegant. The dark Blue hue with a gradient finish across the back of the panel blending into a seemingly lighter blue colour on the curved edges gives it a dual tone effect, making it look strikingly smart and sleek. The deadly combination of stunning looks with it's innovative and latest advancements and novelty features make the M40 quite a pleasure to own and use and in my opinion makes it one of the best budget smartphones under 20k."
75,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Overall the phone is good but call quality is super poor. Impossible to hear in crowded areas, very low clarity and low sound. Only easy to listen is via earphones. So unless you have the ears of a dog, don't buy this phone."
76,21 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"damage product recieved
mobile also not like premium.. its so high cost according to phone. in this price better MI Oppo or Vivo phones"
77,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Abhishek Gupta,Pathetic in call sound quality...sound coming from screen is only half understandable. Need my money back
78,The manufacturer commented on the review below,jaspreet,"Camera is very poor , the color is quite artifical , its better to buy samsung A-50 , now i am not able to return the phone also because of the phone poor performance.

3 gb ram is used by system , so only 3gb remains for you."
79,25 June 2019,Online shopper,"This is waste of money. I got a defective product with camera lens broken. Still didn't got replacement. Please don't buy this. Battery life is very short. Discharge in just 2 hrs.

Requested for inspection.

Technician was rude. Instead of resolving the problem he began to convince me that I damaged my phone. Why would I do that?.

He updated that there is no issue with my phone and that everything is okay.

When I contacted him and asked the same, he began to use abusive language. I told him that I requested for another inspection. Then he threatened me that he would make sure that I will never get a replacement .

His name is Madhu Cholleti
Phone number is 9494604371"
80,21 June 2019,Vishal G.,"The design is good and sleek and the phone feels light too but I really miss the 3.5 mm audio Jack. The in box earphones sound good but feel quite cheap.
The fingerprint sensor being a conventional one is fast and can also be used to swipe down/up the notification panel.

The UI is quite good and smooth and also includes the dark/night mode which I really love. I increased the animation speed to 0.5x from developer settings which I usually use.

The rear triple camera setup is just okay. You can get 32mp only in one mode and in that too pictures are not very clear. Although the front camera is quite good and can take pictures in portrait mode too. Before this, I was using MIA1 and I feel the rear camera of my 2 year old phone was better than this one. I just hope that the camera improved with future updates as the hardware is very capable and just needs a bit of software tweaks. I've seen in YouTube videos that you can install gcam directly which gives better photos .

The battery is just okay and would harely last a day with moderate usage. It give a screen on time of around 4 hrs.

For gamers, don't expect very high performance. For smooth running of PUBG, You will have to reduce the graphic settings. I didn't play any other game.

The phone does not have an earpiece and instead uses some kind of screen vibration technology to produce sound.

The display is just okay and you will face difficulty reading in open. The punch hole camera looks great and gives a premium look to the phone.

You can get it for 19k using the bank offers.
If you want a very premium looking smartphone with very good UI and a trustworthy brand but can compromise on battery and display(M30 gets a sAMOLED display at a lower price) go for it.

Overall 7/10"
81,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Piyush Choudhary,"Not at all upto the mark, I never write negative reviews, probably first negative review I am writing, I gifted it to my wife on her bday, she did not like this phone at all and purchased the new one, the selfie quality is extremely bad, battery life is not at all good, no option to capture screenshot using three fingers, the screenshot functionality is very complex! This phone not worth 20k, I am extremely disappointed as she have used it just for 3-4 days and purchased a new oppo phone. I know amazon cannot do anything but it's my suggestion to everyone to not to buy any new launched phone until it is oppo, vivo, oneplus or redmi. Worst ever decision to invest my money on this phone as it proved to be worst ever gift I gifted to my wife."
82,21 June 2019,Subhodip Ghosh,"Having switched from Iphone 6 to Samasung M40 was a pleasure and smooth experience. I don't feel I am missing my Iphone any more.

PROS:
1. Screen is really huge and very bright.
2. Viewing angles are good.
3. The feel of the polycarbonate body is really great. Feels like a premium phone.
4. Having NFC is a gread deal.
5. Samasung has done a great job with OneUI. Its fluid smooth.
6. Performace wise this phone is one of tge top having Snapdragon 675. Doesn't heat up at all with average usage.
7. The phone is light weight and form factor is also good.
8. Both front and rear camera take good shots, offers a bunch of features like wide angle shot, slowmo, hyperlapse etc.
9. Pubg, NFS, Asphalt games running like butter. Didn' observe any lag till now.

CONS:
1. Till now I have felt only the battery backup is the concern. Feel like if battery was of 4000mah this would have been great. Though I guess this phone can last 1.5 days with average usage after full charge.

CONCLUSION:
I bet anyone will be amazed by the design and feel of the phone at this price. Really a great deal. Cameras do a great job. Dolby atmos really packs power to your entertainment. ONEUI experience is fluid and one can fall in love with way its designed."
83,The manufacturer commented on the review below,ANKIT LADHA,The Worst Phone ever....it has a big big big Heat issue......very low low battery life.......i played pubj for just 15 minute and i have to leave the game in mid way...because the screen is likely to burn my thumb....please guys dont buy this.....and yes the screen sound cast technology is just f***
84,The manufacturer commented on the review below,praveen,The Worst phone I have ever purchased. The on-screen ear piece technology vibrates my ears and make the ear painful along with Heating issue. IMAGINE: Its like keeping your ears on the Hot Iron box. Can't able to hear the voice and the Selfie camera is very poor. I would not recommend this phone even to my Enemy.
85,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,The camera quality is very poor for 20k. A 3 year old moto g4 plus takes far better photos than this phone
86,24 June 2019,Manoj kumar,Fully loss of money
87,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Prakash Sharma,"Phone looks good. That's all.
Its screen does not get brighten when call is received.
Callers number and name do not appear on the screen but they appear at 'Notification Bar'.
On screen speaker vibrate a lot.
The caller's voice quality is very poor and at times one cannot understand what the caller is saying.
Before I could not down the PROS in the phone, its CONS disappointed me a lot and I decided to return the phone.
Such poor quality product is not expected from the house of Samsung."

value for money"
89,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Om Prakash deo,Surface sound not up to the mark
90,The manufacturer commented on the review below,saurabh,Worst phone. Lots of echoing in speaker. The basic functionality of listening on phone is not good. Battery doed not last morecthan 8 hours. Not worth 20K. Do not buy M40.
91,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ashok T,"Not worth the hard earned money
Software, camera and performance do not add up to the specs.

Update after I got the replacement - Teplacement has the same issue that I had before. Time to sue samsung

Update after 5 days of usage - In display speaker is a big issue. Phone vibrates while speaking; voice from the other side not clear at all.
Biggest issue - The phone screen will not turn on to notify when some one calls. I will have to manually unlock the device, swipe down from notifications in order to see who is calling me. This is a big pain given that I travel a lot and cannot afford to unlock my phone just to see who is calling me. Batter life continues to be below par."
92,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Gurjeet,Cheap product ever by Samsung dnt buy this without super amoled display
93,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Subitha Sankara,"The in call speakers is waste...call audio clarity is very poor, felt vibrations during call in ears...very uncomfortable to make calls....making calls is the basic functionality of phones and Samsung M40 has messed it up big time...looks like I have wasted my money"
94,18 July 2019,Talia,"I got the Seawater Blue variant of this phone & after using it, here's what I found:

The Basics

The Aesthetics:
I got the seawater blue & it's the most gorgeous blue phone I've ever seen. It has an iridescent hue, a glossy, opalescent finish & an overall ombre effect. It is prone to scratches & fingerprints so best used with a case. It looks stylish & catchy even with a clear phone case.

The Screen:
It's a 6.3in crisp & vibrant display with saturated colors. There's a hole notch for the 32MP camera, but it doesn't get in the way. It's big enough but still easy to navigate. It's easy on the eyes & doesn't cause eye strain like LED displays. It's comfortable to view indoors as well as outdoors as it gradually adapts to the ambient light levels.

The Weight:
It's quite light for a phone of this size, weighing 168 grams, doesn't feel bulky in the hand.

The Camera:
Though there's no image stabilization & pictures taken in darkness don't turn out very well, it does very well in natural light, 4K recording and Super Slow-mo video recording. Pet pictures turn out especially good.

The Software:
Intuitive & minimalistic user interface with less bloatware that's more manageable by zipping unused apps.

The Audio:
The screen sound tech feels quite different as it subtly vibrates when the person's talking at the other end. The voices sound a bit different too, slightly hollow; which you get used to after a while. The max call volume is lower than usual.

It doesn't have a regular earphone jack which leaves you with 3 options - to use type C earphones, wireless ones or use with an adapter.

The Battery Life:

A charge in the morning lasts a whole day on average usage. Also owing to the fast charging feature, it takes about an hour and a half to charge completely.

So what's it like to be a daily user of this phone?

It always looks refreshingly sleek & appealing. As you pick it up to use, it unlocks in a jiffy via face recognition or as you instinctively place your finger over the back sensor (as in subconsciously). Then you check your notifications or your usual routine, switching between apps seamlessly without any stutter. Apps launch quickly, the interface is smooth, and the phone doesn't get too hot when running simple chat and social apps. You'll be good for media consumption on it's huge display. All in all it's up for the task.

IMHO
If you are looking to buy a solid, mid-range smartphone that offers a large display for watching videos, has a decent camera and looks stylish, the M40 is worth considering. It's also great for people who's primary use is checking emails, social media & browsing youtube. Good looks & performance makes it an attractive option at this price point."
95,21 June 2019,arindam Sarkar,"This device is awesome got it today . Very fast delivery from Amazon.

Pros ..
1. Gorgeous looking from back ( sea water blue )
2.wide angle camera lens"
101,The manufacturer commented on the review below,JJ,"Poor battery backup. With minimal WhatsApp and calls battery drained out in 7 to 8 hours.
On call extra bass is noticed and the backside case I can feel that"
102,24 June 2019,Bharat L.,"This is in reference to Samsung M40 i have received on 22nd june
Firstly There is white spot on the camera Front camera .

104,The manufacturer commented on the review below,ravi,Don't buy this product your money is waste if u buy this product not working properly and ear voulme is not coming
105,24 June 2019,AMG,No value for money better go for M30. M40 phone is a downgrade from M30. I want to return this phone
106,23 June 2019,Ashish Patel,"Smartphone feels smooth in touch and in operating, battery life needs to charge if used for prolong time and take about 15-20 minutes for charging it in normal state , by the way who wants to spend whole day and night with phone lol M40 is light weight ,it does help in gaming for entertainment purposes then throw it aside not to get addicted to games. Camera is good , finger print touch unlock is very quick I didn't find any lag if I find any problem with this I'll update , there is Dolby Atmos use wireless bluetooth earbuds move around keeping phone at one place good range of bluetooth, when phone is locked there is screensaver of glance showing different information good for learning new things without searching, overall above average below premium level."
107,21 June 2019,Aditya Singh,It is a very good looking phone. But the only problem is the battery and we have to purchase the type c to 3.5 MM jack adapter .the camera is good with super slow and slow motion mode and in front camera there is a wide mode too . And I think it is a very good phone . I think it is better than a50 because it gets in display finger print which is extremely slow and irritating.
108,The manufacturer commented on the review below,NAVEEN CARPENTER,"Not dedicated sim slot 2 sim & 1 chip not at a time .
Sound quality not good as they asked.
3.5 mm Jack is not available
Battery backup is not good.

110,23 June 2019,Priyank Sheth,"Overall it's a good phone in this budget but major issues are, it has LCD Display so the sharpness of images is poor as compared to the 32MP camera, secondly- removing ear piece and using Screen Sound Technology is the worst thing...Volume during calls is too low and you can't hear properly, so it's the worst thing you can have in this phone. Also battery drains little faster as compared to other phones. It's good to buy but could be much more better !"
111,21 June 2019,arish,"Pros : 1. Good display
2. Light weight

112,21 June 2019,Amazon Customer,Phone is awesome but the ear phone that came with the device is not working. When asked for replacement they are giving option to replace the complete device. Which is unfair as it took 5 hrs for setting up device and installing apps
113,21 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Built quality, Camera result and performance is good as expected, it offers an Infinity-O display that is unique to this segment, a Snapdragon 675 chipset and a 32MP triple camera setup.

- Audio volume is very slow."
116,24 June 2019,Arun Goswami,Ear speaker is not available in this phone so call display call quality is very very poor. I sold out this mobile on olx due to this reason.
117,25 June 2019,Sadanand Rayar,Everything is good.
118,18 July 2019,Injamamul Golder,"Samsung finally has hit the sweet spot. This device has everything you need. It has the punchole display, a wide angle camera, Snapdragon 675 processor and so on. What more do you want in a mid-range smartphone.

I would trust Samsung any given day than Mi and those other companies who are currently making mid-range smartphones.

The battery backup is good and it lasts throughout the day. Plus fast changing saves a lot of time. This display is by far the best display I've come across on a phone. The Colors are great and it's nice to watch content on it.

Overall a very good mid-range smartphone. Recommended."
119,The manufacturer commented on the review below,dhanapal,"I had purchased the device on first day flash sale from Amazon. Thanks Amazon for the speed delivery. Phone looks good in the starting and after five days got the hanging issue once. So, I tried to reboot the device, but I got the error screen and and device not re-booted. After couple of minutes, I selected some option from the error screen and then only app got rebooted successfully. I am very much disappointed after seeing the error screen n 5 days of usage."
120,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Siddhartha Deb,"Pros:
1. Design.
2. Speed and Processor.
3. Brand.

Cons:
1. Poor Camera quality.
2. Fast charging doesn’t help. Takes almost 1hr 50mins to full charge.
3. On screen sound technology is poor. Feels hollow sound while on call.
4. Automatic brightness doesn’t work well.

I retuned it after using nearly 1week. Thanks to amazon they took it back though I had to struggle a lot in complaining, conducting amazon technician visit at home and lot of follow ups."

123,5 July 2019,Jeron,"Samsung has launched its M series phones 6 months ago and we have seen some of the best in class budget phones in the m series. Now with this M40, Samsung has leveled up their game in competition with the Chinese legends. The M40 has certain exclusive features to outrun its competitors. The Infinity O display, under display speaker and the triple camera setup are some of its highlighted features. I have been using this device rigorously for a few days, so do read my review till the end before you buy this phone.

Before jumping into the review, let's see some of the technical specs.

=============

📦 Type - C Basic Earphones.
📦 Sim Ejector Pin.
📦 User Manual.

=======
Design
=======
The M40 looks stunning in terms of design, Samsung has provided 2 colour variants on the M40, Sea Water Blue and Mid Night Blue. I'm a classic person, so I chose the Mid Night Blue instead of the Sea Water Blue. Both colours are great in its own style.

The phone's body is made of plastic, but Samsung has managed to give a glass finish to the plastic body.

The absence of 3.5mm headphone jack might be an issue for some users, Samsung has provided a basic type c earphone in the box for the wired earphones users. I mostly use wireless earphones, so with Dolby atoms, it's not a big issue for me.

The fingerprint sensor is on the backside as usual. (We'll talk about the performance later in the review).

The triple camera setup looks good and takes some impressive shots, Samsung has managed to keep the camera inside the body, though it does pop out a bit, but it's not an issue while keeping the phone on a flat surface. The ring around the wide-angle sensor does deserve a mention here, it looks good when looking at the camera.

The Infinity O display looks amazing, it's a great improvement over the dewdrop notch and a regular notch. The punch hole is at a corner of the display, so it doesn't disturb the viewing while playing games or watching videos. I kind prefer this one over the other 2.

Samsung M40 is a great phone in terms of design. I really like the Infinity O display.

=======
Display
=======
The Samsung M40 features a 6.3-inch FHD+ Infinity O Display with a 91.5% Screen to body ratio. I really hoped for a Super AMOLED Display on this, considering the lower priced M30 which comes with one. Even without a Super AMOLED Display, the display looks sharp with vibrant colours and has good viewing angles.

The Widevine L1 Certification allows us to watch Full HD contents on Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.

The display is clear and great on normal conditions, but we have to turn the brightness to full in order to get better visibility on direct sunlight.

=======
Camera
=======
Now let's talk about the camera. We have a triple camera setup on the rear. The first sensor is a 32 Megapixel with F1.7 Aperture and the second one is an ultra-wide sensor of 8 Megapixel with F2.2 Aperture, the third one is a 5 Megapixel depth sensor. I tried taking some indoor and outdoor shots with the M40, the camera performs quite good in outdoor conditions, but we can notice a slight lag in performance at indoor conditions.

Now, let's talk about the front camera, on the front we have a 16 Megapixel camera with F2.0 Aperture. The front camera performs great both indoors and outdoors.

The camera is good on overall basis, but Samsung does have to work on the image processing. It can be improved by updates.

============
Performance
============
Now, down to the most important part. The M40 runs on a Snapdragon 675 processor, which is seen on most of the phones in this price range. The Snapdragon 675 is a powerful and efficient chipset. I've used the phone for a few days, I didn't feel any issues on day to day usage. I tried playing some Pubg with this and it's really great, the punch hole display is very efficient for games as the notch is at a corner, we get better visibility. The Snapdragon 675 is great for a day to day performance and can easily carry out any hard tasks.

The One UI on top android pie is fresh and gives a good experience. Though regular Samsung users might miss some features from their old UI.

Now, let's talk about the overall performance. The M40 has an under-screen speaker which works great for calls, the call quality is amazing. It also supports dual VOLTE. The fingerprint sensor works perfectly every time, but there's a slight delay which was improved after an OTA Update.

On Overall basis, the M40 performs great for a mid-range phone. Though there is some small issues here and there, which can be improved over updates.

=======
Battery
=======
The M40 has a 3500mAh battery which sounds small when compared with the competitors who offer 4000 and some even 5000mAh. As I said earlier, the Snapdragon 675 is a powerful and Efficient processor which is efficiently pushing the battery upto its limit. The battery can easily last for a day or two on regular usage and can last for at least a day on heavy usage. The fast charger is pretty much quick to charge, I'm not sure about the exact time of full charge, but roughly it takes a little over an hour to fully charge the device.

=======
Verdict
=======
Finally, we are here at the end of the review. The Samsung Galaxy M40 is a decent phone in the mid-range segment and it is packed with some exclusive features to take out it's competitors. Though it does have some minor cons, but the pros far outweigh the cons. In my opinion, The M40 is a best option under 20k."
124,4 July 2019,iShahrukh,"Samsung M40 is a premium phone with stylish looks, manufactured under ‘Make in India’ initiative which is sure to turn many heads. However, this phone is typically meant to use in India and can be activated only via Indian SIM cards. The highlights of the product are detailed as follows:

1) Quite Lightweight with Premium Looks – M40 is very light to hold onto and got a premium feel to it due to the sleek design. It is perfect for any occasion and would merge with any fashion statement. The seawater colour looks awesome and it got a unique double tone effect which will charm you up every now and then.

2) Excellent Display with Thin Bezels – The display of the phone is excellent and outperforms any smartphone device I have held onto, till date. The ultra-thin bezels and high screen-to-body ratio make justice to the same. FHD videos on the phone look very detailed that other FHD screens and with time the punch hole camera will not bother you much; rather you will think it as a ‘bindi’ which beautifies your phone.

3) Lightning Fast Fingerprint Sensor – The fingerprint sensor to unlock the device or apps works almost instantly as it is ultra-fast. The face unlock, on the other hand, is not that fast and will not work quite well if the hand-face coordination is not there.

4) Fast Charging with Good Battery Backup – The charging of the M40 is quite fast and it typically charges 1% of the battery in less than a minute, thanks to the USB-C port. I have charged the phone from around 20% to 80% in roughly about 50 minutes. The battery backup on the phone is quite good, too.

5) Average Camera Performance with Front Screen Flash – The camera of the phone works quite well but I have termed it average solely due to the hype it creates on the triple camera setup. I have, however, on particular occasions felt that the picture output is not entirely crispy as it should be with the smartphone these days. Although there is no physical front flash, the screen flash works well in low light conditions for a selfie. The selfie camera works well in normal lighting conditions.

6) Below Average Ear Speaker – The phone’s most hyped screen speaker (meant for talking over the phone) is sadly below average. I have had not got used to it yet and use headphones for phone calls. Other speakers, for loudspeakers or music playback, works like charm.

7) Butter flow Performance with Apps, Minor lags with PUBG – Any apps I have used on this phone works like a charm without any issues, whatsoever. PUBG starts almost instantly and continues flawlessly for about half an hour while it starts to lag a bit. A quick restart will easily fix it, so, there should have been an option in the Game Launcher which would clear cache and optimize the phone for the game without the need to close the particular game.

8) Unitive UI but Yearns for more Feature – The UI of the phone is very crystal clear and all the similar used settings are packed in unison. However, very basic features, like, displaying connection speed, LED notifications, or even IR blaster are something we expect in our smartphone these days.

9) No Headphone Jack but USB-C Headphones Included – The 3.5mm headphone jack is missing to make in line with the classy design of the phone. Samsung thus provides with USB-C headphone which is quite good for music playback as well as phone calls. However, it would have been a bright idea on the part of the brand to provide with USB-C to 3.5mm connector, instead of a headphone which would ensure that all our previous headphones can be used with this phone.

10) Indian Warranty Only – In this era of globalization, it is very hard to think that a multinational brand like Samsung offers an only local country warranty. I am honestly very disappointed at this approach from once a market leader.

M40 has its own charm and definitely, a phone one would like to own. I have been quite satisfied with the buy due to its overall performances, so far."
125,5 July 2019,Priyanka,"So I purchased this product when a friend talked highly about this new phone in the market. Well, I must say I had my differences when it came down to mobile phone brands but I must say after this all-new M40 from Samsung I am reconsidering my choice in brands.

The notable features that this phone has besides the very basic features are:
1. It has a beautiful Infinity O display with a near bezel-free experience with a water drop notch.
2. It has a mind-blowing speed because of its Snapdragon 675 processor.
3. 32 MP+ 8 MP+ 5 MP TRIPLE CAMERA! And that too with 4k recording. Like wow!
4. This phone has brought the notch up by introducing On Screen Sound technology where the sound is emitted from within phone and below the screen. This definitely upgrades the bezel-free experience.
5. Also, it’s Android Pie! And guess what's more impressive? It has NIGHT MODE!
6. The best thing about this phone is it has got a Widevine L1 certification which lets you stream FULL HD content on any streaming networks. Oh and the Midnight Blue looks just so good.
7. It has whooping internal storage of 128gb which again is expandable.
8. And if you love to spend a really lot of time on your phone but at the same time keep worrying about a charging port nearby, this might be your ultimate phone of long battery life.
9. It also has features like Device care, Data saving, Digital wellbeing, Panic mode, Dual Messenger and many more options to explore.
10. It has got a very fast fingerprint sensor on the rear and a Face unlock system as well.

The best sleek, good performance and brilliant display you can get at this budget. Like what else could I have asked for at this price?"
126,21 June 2019,Mangesh lohare,Camera is average selfie camera was blurred
127,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Vicky D,"One of the worst mobile one can purchase in this price Range. Some of the worst things about this mobile are:
1. Extremely poor rear camer ,something that u can't expect from samsung. May be to reduce d cost they used inferior quality camera this time.
2. Headphone Jack is C type, hence u won't be able to play ur favourite music with ur regular headphone.
3. Display is not S Amoled. Hence, it looks very baad and hurts ur eyes after long uses.
4. Full screen is not supported for most of the apps hence the inbuilt camera looks like an ordinary camera while using.
5. Plastic body of inferior quality
6. Gets heated up after prolonged uses.
7. It hangs after normal use.
8. Battery drains fast and is only 3500Mah"
128,14 July 2019,Art,"Disclaimer: This is a layman review after 2 day use.

Rating: 4.5 stars (rounded off to 5)

Right of the bat let me just say that this is a marvellous phone! I have just ONE complaint and barring that, I would say this is the best in the market currently for this price.

Let me start with what I consider the only con with this device - the call quality. How can Samsung get this wrong, I wonder. I had read this in a couple of reviews but glossed over it assuming it can’t be true. Turns out, there IS some issue with the call quality- there is always some vibration sound which although not very discernible, exists. But here is why this particular problem doesn’t affect me- I am always on handsfree either with Bluetooth or an earphone and so all my calls are routed via one of them and I get crystal clear clarity in both minus the vibration sound. It is only when I talk with the handset which is very very rare does the Zzzzzzzz set in. Not to say it affects the call clarity per se – you can hear the other side crystal clear- but it is annoying as hell. I had my mother use it and she did not find the vibration thingy irritating so I guess it may not be a universal thing. Either case if you use the earphone/headphone/Bluetooth/speaker then you won’t face the problem but if you are entirely reliant on the handset then this can be a deal breaker.

Now coming to the things I loved: Too many to list so I will keep it short.

Firstly the look and feel is very premium. It feels more like a luxury segment phone than a budget phone. The seawater blue cover is breathtaking and unique.

Amazing display. Everything looks sharp and clear.

The camera is a joy to take pics with! Not sure why some reviews diss the camera quality- I found it pretty awesome.

The battery seems decent. Could have been better but I have charged it only once these last 2 days and it is still going strong with average use.

Last word: Samsung doesn’t disappoint. Just wish the call quality was minus the vibration effect. Rest all perfect."
129,The manufacturer commented on the review below,abhishikth devadas,"It's been 3-4 days since I'm using this phone and my overall experience is pathetic... first of all the voice quality during the call is very bad you barely listen when you are on call, secondly the battery life of this phone is worse, though it has 3500 mAh battery it's drains out so fastly and sometimes phone overheat...
Don't recommend anyone to buy this phone and waste your money..."
130,The manufacturer commented on the review below,VINAY_SABH,On screen sound technology gives a feeling of echos & vibrations in entire screen while hearing. Not very comfortable. Think before buy if anyone feels that hearing voice is not important for him/her.
131,21 June 2019,siva,"Display nice, I feel this phone heating issue"
132,22 June 2019,Mynu,First I liked the display ...this is the main reason to bought this mobile.back camera also pretty good .battery will come one day... if we use 24 hrs.....and mobile is simply awesome very slim ....any one can like
133,22 June 2019,Abhi,This was the best phone i was at this price its look awesome and its design was so cool i attached some pic you can watch it in midnight blue and its storage oh my god 128 GB and 6 GB storage [ when you operate the phone first time its become so hot but after all the process its become normal you can use it freely and enjoy it as you want.
134,21 June 2019,Amazon Customer,It looks absolutely stunning when it comes to design and performance. However I am a bit disappointed with its battery backup. I bought it couple of days back and will be evaluating it further.
135,22 June 2019,saisarvesh,"I was hesitating to purchase a Samsung phone but after a lot of review, I've decided to go for M40. I must tell you that this phone looks so cool in your hands with that premium look and punch hole display. Display is the biggest plus for this phone.

Tou can feel the difference between exynos and Snapdragon processor clearly. My friend has got Samsung A50 on which I see a slight noticable lag when opening the apps..but M40 is much smoother and faster.

Battery is not draining fast...but 4000 mah would have been better."
136,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Varaprasad,performance is gud..
137,22 June 2019,Rajesh Pal,"The product from the home of Samsung is excellent, but there are two shortcomings I have found that fingerprint unlock is in back side while everyone is coming with onscreen unlock.

Secondly the camera is not as per my expectation.

Rest is an excellent phone, nice look and so handy."
138,21 June 2019,Bhavya,"It is a great phone if we compare it with old Samsung phones these are much better both quality, specs and price.
Pros
1. Good build quality
2. Infinity O display is just amazing.
3. Great design
4. Triple camera setup with main 32 mp camera.
5. front camera is good.
6. One ui with android pie.
7. Fast charging support 15w
8. Type-c earphones are included.
9. Snapdragon 675 soc
10. 6gb ram & 128gb internal storage.
11. Has NFC support as well.

Cons
1. No 3.5 mm audio jack
2. Tft display which is not that good at outdoor
3. No case or protective film pre applied
4. Rear camera is clear but when we zoom pic little bit there is no detailing. Samsung should work on its camera and puch ota soon.
5. Battery is small only 3500 mah which is very less from its predecessors which have 5000mah battery.

Here are pros and cons from my perspective and If you like my review made it helpful so it helps other people as well.
And if you want to see its true video I have uploaded on YouTube by ""Gadget Pages"" you can watch there as well.
I have uploaded some pictures which can give you idea of its camera."
139,The manufacturer commented on the review below,shruthi,"Build quality is great and OneUI is clean; and that's where the liking for this phone will end.

What you will not like:
_ Poor camera.
_ No 3.5mm headphone jack.
_ No AMOLED display. But the picture quality is good.
_ No warm colour setting in the phone! There's a night mode. But it just makes the system UI dark instead of light. Like the ""Light"" or ""Dark"" mode in Windows 10. Cheaper phones have warm colour mode for blue light filter. OneUI on flagship models have a Screen Mode option, where you can set the White Balance slider to cool or warm. Although M40 has OneUI, there's no such option. I don't understand why. May be cost cutting. But how?
_ On call voice clarity is bad. Especially, if you're outside in traffic, you will not be able to hear most of the conversation.

Honest opinion - M40 is not really worth 20k. Chinese brands offer more value for money and that too below 15k."
140,28 June 2019,Shashikant Jadhav,"Camera quality is not up to mark, looking the pics on a big screen will help you realise the pixalation.
The USB-C to Aux converter should have been provided or at least the one that can be used for this mobile, as the headphones came along with the package sucks and when I tried multiple other USBC to Aux converters none of them got detected. These are the basic requirements.
The in screen speaker is also not good, loudness, as if u hear a sound bar very close to your ear, low frequency distortion, poor sound quality when talking on phones are issues."
141,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Raj,"Camera quality is not good,
Screen quality is not good,
Battery backup not good."
142,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Expert,"Poor camera quality, both front and back. Shoots blurred photos. Speaker quality and volume is below average. Can't be used with single hand, size wise it feels very tall phone and slightly wide too. This phone is primarily for those looking for good looks and smooth performance."
143,24 June 2019,Kiki Singh 🌟,"I bought the phone last week, below are the Pros and Cons:
-Features like APPLOCK, Call Recorder, Scanner are not available. These features are available in Samsung's other more costly phones but NOT in this phone.
-Gesture features like Palm swipe or finger scroll to take screenshot is not available.
-Camera quality - Good.
-Battery Life - Not good. Drains very fast. I have to charge the phone two times in a day.
-Value for money - Yes. But battery drain will annoy you."
144,27 June 2019,Dinesh K.,"After using 4 days i am writing this review..

Pros..
1. Phone is light weight and looks pretty ( girlish)
2. Display is unlike 20k range phones, its superb immersive , You can't compare even with 30k range smartphones
3. Camera's ultra wide angle mode is very impressive covers almost our entire view angle.

Cons..
1. Charging cable is too short , hardly it will reach upto your bed and table from socket.
2 Back camera quality is average and selfie camera needs lots of improvements. Image quality is too poor.
3. Battery is average 1 day on normal use.
4. Biggest issue with phone is notification and charging led indicator absence. You can only get to know you notification by turning diaplay on & no sign while phone is charging.
5.Ear piece volume while call is not like open speakers, low sound.
6.Screen bleeding issue around hole punch and side edges of diaplay.
7. Charging is not so quick it takes almost average time to charge."
145,11 July 2019,Akshay,"Included with features like Qualcomm processor, a triple-rear camera setup, and Infinity-O display, Samsung Galaxy M40 is just at Rs. 19,990. Yet, is it any great? Go through to ready my complete review.
A little while back, on June 11, Samsung launched its fourth cellphone in the current Galaxy M series, named the Samsung Galaxy M40.
Performance and One UI of Samsung Galaxy M40
In the Galaxy M40, Samsung has given Qualcomm's prevalent Snapdragon 675 SoC. The equivalent was additionally included in Galaxy A70, and M40 is the 2nd cell phone for Samsung to utilize the chipset. It comes with 128GB of internal storage and 6GB of RAM. The smartphone has hybrid SIM slot, which states you can either utilize one SIM card with a microSD card or two SIM cards (Nano-SIM+Nano-SIM).
With regards to operation, the Galaxy M40 functions admirably in dealing with everyday works or even perform heavy various tasks. During my review, I didn't discover any stutter or lag. The Samsung Galaxy M40 is first M series smartphone come running Android 9 Pie-based OneUI. M series smartphones had Experience UI 9.5 and Android 8.1 Oreo in the past. So, it's a much-needed development. Most recent OneUI of Samsung is one the great Android overlay currently, and it functioned smooth as well. I discovered couple of missing features in the UI, which are available on Samsung's marginally premium cellphones. In the Galaxy M40, you can neither alter the presentation tone and nor do you have two taps to wake gesture. I am not certain, if Samsung, purposefully, left out those features.
Going to the gaming on the Samsung Galaxy M40, the prominent high-graphic PUBG functioned good. By default, it happens on high-graphic settings. I didn't discover edge drops, the smartphone didn't warm much while long sessions and there was next to no load time. You can be rest guaranteed of different gaming performance also. Generally speaking, the processor and software mix functions extraordinary on the Samsung Galaxy M40.
Design and Punch-hole display of Samsung Galaxy M40
The Galaxy M40 is first reasonable smartphone by Samsung to offer punch-hole display. As I would like to say, it's the best style I've ever seen from Samsung in quite a while. The mobile fits and feels extremely brilliant in hands. This smartphone is very lightweight and I wouldn't fret the polycarbonate body over the metal or glass, if that holds the weight within proper limits.

Upfront, you get a 6.3-inch full-HD+ TFT LCD Infinity-O or punch-hole display, which is bright and pleasant. The viewing angles, color reproduction, and touch response are satisfactory on this presentation. The bottom chin and bezels are genuinely negligible, and doesn't look bad. Additionally, the front camera punch-hole is exceptionally minor, and the general style and design resembles an excellent flagship mobile.
Curiously, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is first ever cell phone to utilize ""On Screen Sound"" innovation. It means that there is no earpiece grill; and rather the whole display twice up as the speaker for voice calls. Sadly, it is not good innovation to be completely frank, in light of the fact that makes mild vibration and it doesn't feel great when you keep the ear close. Likewise, the result doesn't come comparable to the conventional speaker result. Having said that, it is as yet operational however you'll experience difficulties hearing in to the individual available on a call-in noisy environment.
Battery performance, Fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock of Samsung Galaxy M40
The Samsung Galaxy M40 packs a 3,500mAh battery with USB Type-C and 15W quick charging help. While I was writing my review, the battery backup of M40 was generally useful for the whole day. My utilization example can be contemplated as better than expected, however not incredibly high. It incorporated maps navigation, web surfing, social media apps, bit of video surfing, and web surfing. The mobile doesn't warm much and the battery doesn't get depleted too rapidly while navigating. I additionally observed the battery charging to be sensibly great, however not so quick. It for the most part took around 1 hour 45 minutes to completely charge the mobile from 0 to 100.
Samsung gives a face unlock and physical unique finger impression scanner feature on the Galaxy M40. I observed the unique finger impression scanner to be somewhat irritable. The face acknowledgment is additionally very quick, yet at the same time opens with eyes-shut, which should be fixed for all Samsung cell phones.
Camera Performance of Samsung Galaxy M40
Like Galaxy A70, the Galaxy M40 packs a 3-camera lens setup at the back. It comprises of a 32-megapixel primary sensor with a f/1.7 aperture, a secondary 8-megapixel ultra-wide (123 degree) angle lens with f/2.2, and a 5-megapixel f/2.2 sensor for depth. Unfortunately, there is no Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), yet you can make video up to 4K at 30fps and 720p slow motion video-recordings at 240fps.
I observed the camera of Samsung Galaxy M40 to be not too bad generally during my review. It would work well for you in many situations, particularly in sunlight. The camera adjusts saturation, high dynamic range (HDR), and colors great. The sunshine shots had great focus sharpness, however sadly passed up on finer details.
This setup in any case works admirably and scene optimizer mode improves the result somewhat more for your preferring. On Galaxy M40, the 123-degrees ultra-wide-angle lens functions admirably, and the company has resolved the fish-eye impact problem. You can take enormous gathering shots or greater scene than any cell phone camera available in this cost.
The Galaxy M40 utilizes a 16-megapixel f/2.0 lens for the front selfie camera, which is being placed on left corner of the display. It is very small and doesn't appear diverting on the display. Discussing its function, it captures great selfies and keeps the natural skin-tone. The 'Live Focus' bokeh mode gives you a chance to set the blur intensity, however the edge recognition isn't good.
Should you purchase Samsung Galaxy M40?
As I would like to say, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is one of the best mobiles in this cost. The mobile provides most recent punch-hole display, a modern style and an adequately ground-breaking processor for Rs 19,990. The camera experience is not the most powerful in its cost, however genuinely great in general. The smartphone is an enjoyment for gaming users. What it doesn’t have is a 3.5mm audio port; however, Samsung gives USB Type-C earphones in the box. Be that as it may, I would even now call the Galaxy M40 a decent blend of software and hardware from Samsung, which didn't give me a chance to miss having a flagship mobile."

147,30 June 2019,Shashank shankar,"I had bought this piece for the purpose of gifting it to my better half who was madly in love with her existing mi phone of lower make. I thought it would be a nice surprise given the much created hype around it. However, that was not to be! In a couple of days of use came about glaring lag in terms of innovation. This phone does not have an inbuilt app lock system which in turn meant one has to download a third party app to secure ones app. In other words one had to handover one's house keys to one's dubious neighbour and wish everything remained safe thats because one never knows what kind of data an application might gather once installed. Any which ways I did download an app locker app which- to my horror- when found inadequate refused to get uninstalled easily!!
I had to read the uninstallation process thoroughly to get it removed from my device. An epiphany occured- getting a monkey off my back made no better sense than this time. Further, it had no ir port which is so very common in mi sets. this meant letting go a free universal remote. Camera- i see a lot of discussion happen around this thing in recent timws was average. battery was average. But the most annoying thing was the technology which professes that the sound comes from the surface of the screen. Its a dumb idea. the sound came as if some one had put on a plastic cover over a capable woofer in a common sound system. I can go on and on against this technology but in a single word for me this phone is a bad idea if you are an mi buff.
Am ruing why i chose to experiment!!😢😢
i recommend an mi upgrade."
148,30 June 2019,M. Kishore,"Camera satisfactory. Battery could have been of bigger capacity. Just at unpack of box, the SIM Tray didn't came out with the provided pin. I had to take brand-new device to Service Center. Initially they said that the tray is stuck inside, but somehow they pulled it out. Now, I'm using the phone. Only worry is that it shouldn't be another struggle when taking out the the SIM.
Other wise no other issues. Screen Sound is average and needs improvement.
Worth at the price range."
149,21 June 2019,Sanjeev Sood,Fantastic mobile at this price Samsung finally nailed it
150,5 July 2019,Shubham,"Please read the review if you are planning to purchase the same.

I bought this phone few days back from the sale in Midnight Blue Color which is Amazing

It comes in a nice packaging and in box it includes Charging adapter, cable, type-c earphones, user manual and sim ejector.

Phone quality is good as its very light weight and even compaq to use it and carry as it only weighs 170 grams something and display resolution is not that much big as of other phones in this price range even can be used by 1 hand only.

Rear panel of the phone looks similar to all M series phone, and you will find fingerprint sensor at the back.

In the front you will get punch hole display that's the very new in market and only available with samsung M40 as of now.

It features triple camera at back which gives awesome picture quality.

New Feature is Screen Sound Technology which means the sound is delivered from under display which is basically done to reduce bezels.

In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.

As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.

PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.

GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works great.

STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.

SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience.

In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.

BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.

It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.

Overall a worth buy purchase and my recommendation for this phone are highly valuable for the one who is planing to purchase."
151,8 August 2019,Arya Panjikar,"Hey Guys, m going to review for this New samsung M40,
m using this phone past 1 month and trust me guys its worst phone ever i purchased till now.the basic functionality of this phone is not working smoothly like phone calls and camera that we cant expect from Samsung phones, During on call you are not clearly audible voice from other people, such a cheap quality phone and its screen quality is not up to the mark ,battery drains very easily and the worst thing is network quality for this device u will not get signal very easily and the technology OST which should not use for any phone i think ,so according to me please dont buy this phone and dont waste your money ,isse accha nokia 1100 use karlo"
152,2 September 2019,Suman,"Comparing with my last phone Moto G5 S+,

Cons
1. Finger print scanner is sluggish, the screen takes time to appear after processing the scan.

2. Sluggish when I am using higer quality to play PUBG.

3. The phone speakers are not that good.

4. At high Zoom stability is v poor.

5. Poor Display under Sunlight even with auto brightness

Pros.
1. Clicks like DSLR but only mid range and close ups.

2. Look wise classy.

3. Neat UI

4. Battery is avg

5. Greater details and better display but indoors.

6. Face recognition is very fast, although my last ph did not had FR but I have seen ppl using IPhone have to literally look at the camera and struggle especially if you were specs.."
153,24 June 2019,anusha,More MAH battery required but overall it's awesome
154,28 June 2019,Hello12,"I think this is a great phone that anyone would want to have. The phone is amazing. This is my second week using it.

1.Security
The phone comes loaded with several security features. Facelock works well, fingerprint is quite fast. There's a virus scanner too powered by McAfee. It's good to know that you're safe on that end too.

2. Design and display
I love the design of the phone. Feels premium and looks premium. Display is massive, infinity O. I tried streaming on Netflix, definitely looks great.

3. Camera
I am not a huge fan of pictures but I can tell when I see a good picture taken by a good camera. Three cameras that perform well in lit areas but the pictures don't look quite sharp. They look a bit washed out. But hey, the camera is good. The front camera does its job. Nice pictures, detailed and kinda looks sharp.

4. Performance and memory.
Blown my mind. I haven't noticed any stutters when switching tabs, or any lag. Really fast phone. I tried playing Darkness Rises. It's a demanding game when it comes to graphics and performance but the phone handles it like a boss. PUBG players will definitely love it.

5. Battery
This right here is an issue for me. Yes it has a fast charge but the battery doesn't really last that long. A day should be about how long you can go depending on how you are using it.

6. No 3.5 mm headset Jack. Yupp. It doesn't have it. I love my music, and I don't mind that it's missing this. I use bluetooth headphones most of the time. When I am not, I don't mind using the type c headsets that come with the phone. Which are quite good. I love the fact that I am different. 😅. And oh the earpiece speaker is within the display, that sure does look cool.

Verdict Time👨🏾‍⚖
Do I think you should buy it? Obviously you should🙄😁, it's a great phone by a great brand. It looks stylish and looks premium. Performs really well and definitely a worthy investment considering the price. I would buy me another if I had to.😌"
155,21 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"The phone is nice, as shown in d pictures. I bought the seawater blue, looks great.
Only disappointment was the CAMERA.the images are so soft n blur , especially the front camera. I don't think anyone from Samsung tested this camera before selling. Hope Samsung sends an UPDATE soon. Camera needs to be repaired."
156,1 August 2019,Amazon Customer,"i am using smart phones from time Nokia dominated the market. i bought M40 after reading its reviews. What reviewer says and what i found after comparing to my old different phone is that this is a paid reviewers WOW phone . Or I got a fake Galaxy M40
sound quality is wow bed ,finger touch is erratic but some time it say to clean touch sensor, too much adds after opening any apps, installed apps never heard off, you cannot uninstall them.my favorite apps not working. etc, etc
over all not good experience and wanted to change to my old mobile .
horrible , horrible battery life . need multiple charges per day and you don't find type c fast charger every where
those who gave 5 stars must have got good M40 or i got a fake phone from my favorite AMAZON"

No hang, no minus attentions at this time, detail review will do after some significant use of the product.

Overall nice product in this price"
160,15 August 2019,Nitesh,"I am not a professinal reviewer but will try to help you guys.

Consider other options rather than buying this phone as it is overpriced. It should have been priced below 16500.

This is why:

I will start with the positives.

* The phone is good to hold as it is sleek
* It looks good because of the glossy finish and the punch hole camera.
* It has 6gb of RAM
* Samsung UI is good to use and gives some great customization options.
* Responsive fingerprint sensor.

This is why you should not buy this phone:

* I am not happy with the display of this phone and you can see the image for the reason. The screen around the punch hole camera and the edges is too dull and seems like is not properly lit which instantly made me realize that going for Moto one vision could have been a better option. I filed a return after 3-4 days od usage however the inspection agent didn't find any issur with it. I am still not satisfied with that.

* Poor camera performance. All the cameras are underperformers. Click pretty basic pictures and I was getting better or similar results from my previous phone- moto g5s plus. Doesn't suffice the reason of upgrading.

* Face recognition is not super-responsive but does the job. You will not be impressed.

* Battery drain is an issue. It will last a day with average usage. I avoid keeping the settings that drain more battery.

* It has not even been two months and sometimes I see some lag while scrolling (facebook and even contacts at time). Scrolling is a pretty basic things a smartphone must be able to deliver but this one fails. (May be this is an issue with my device specifically)

There is no point of asking for a return once you get the device as a service engineer will be sent at your place and they decide whether this will be eligible for a refund/return. So don't take a chance on that one.

Overall, I am just ok with this phone as it has not amazed me yet. That's why I think it should have been priced below 16500."
161,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Kalyan Tirunagari,"Stay away from this phone if you want to save your money.
I am not sure how this one is garnering positive responses, I believe they are falling for the live focus and other preprocessing filters.
Anyways to start with, Sound screen technology is one innovation that hampers the basic usage of phone, You have to develop sharp ears to understand or hear the other person, while you do that you have to ignore the vibrations of the phone while taking a call, This is one big compromise, ofcourse you can train yourself as i did to live with it after 10-15 days.
Camera: 2015 released redmi note 3 has better selfies than this one, it has unnecessary filters, even if you install an app which takes RAW images, the quality is super bad. What would i do with a wide angle when the quality of the camera itself is bad.
Battery: Serious gaming will drain it out in 4-5 hours, if it is the situation now, imagine how it will be in a year.

My suggestion would be filter our 1-star ratings and seriously read through, don't ignore them, find out if you see a pattern, if you still are lured with 5-Stars please go ahead and don't tell me that I have not warned you!!"
162,18 September 2019,Ankur Choudhary,"You can find better phones than this one within 20000. Don’t purchase it just because it has in screen camera like S10, rest it’s a average phone. Battery backup hardly last for 15-16 hours within regular use(internet surfing, Whatsapp, fb etc). There are variety of camera modes in it but camera is all about the real colour tone and quality photos which you’ll not able to get using this device as selfie and back camera is just average. I wasn’t expected much in 20k but my iPhone SE of 15000 Rs is way better in terms of camera and quite equal in battery backup as well"

The battery is the worst part, it hardly lasts 6-7 hours without even using heavy apps. 16mp selfie camera is like 3mp camera, rear camera is okay but not worth for a 32mp camera. onscreen call sound is not clear.
Total waste of money. I thought samsung has improved but i was wrong."
166,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"worst phone of samsung.. bad battery life.. n the most annoying thing for which u buy phone ,sound..receiving sound from caller end, voice is muffled.. i infact contact to customer care..they tested falsily n said my device is good.. blv on me u cnt hear good sound when other person speak.. total wastage of money...."
167,21 June 2019,amit,Video quality very poor
168,25 August 2019,Gaurav,"Appears Samsung has launched this product in a hurry. Too many software issues within 1 month of usage. After using for 1 month, all excitement of using a latest product has gone. Sometimes even the basic functions malfunction which are restored (sometimes not) only after a restart. Within days, it again needs a restart. Not exactly the one to be recommended as you shell out 20k for it and do not have a smooth experience even for a month. Nothing special about the much hyped camera and fingerprint sensor too. The 10 day replacement window is too small for such products. Amazon please take note. Was carrying too many expectations, simply disappointed."
169,11 July 2019,amarnath,"positive :
light weight
low SAR value
Memory ang RAM best
display is perfect face scanning is ultimate
Camera is good but at the first you need to change some camera settings for better photos do not decide based on negative comments about camera . camera is good
good features at better price
gorilla glass
fast charging
snapdragon processor mobile never get hang at multiple tasks
Negative :
with internet ON u can use mobile for 1 day after full charge
little bit heating
hybrid slot
type C earphones

apart from all negative comments at this budget this is the best mobile compared to other brands."
170,25 June 2019,rathish,"Its only second day after my purchase, my reviews are as follows for now.
LOOK _good as i like the ""O"" display but in back case gap between joints are little big,so dust could be accumulated fast.
Performance _Ok till now, Themes in display are irritating but could download different. I am editing after two days use. Face unlock not working properly
Battery_ average as drains in a day on normal use. but in stand by last bit more. charging cable is too short.
earphone provided is good
overall_ good at this price range"

Looks good,but genrate heat while charging and using internet,very pathetic,camera quality not up to the mark,while talking with some one,whole screen vibrate with noise"
172,26 June 2019,Nandha Kumar T,"Hi in this phone the major drawback is the speaker quality.. the opposite party voice is not clear, it will be broad and seems like they are speaking from inside the well. I opted for return but Amazon declined as it is the feature of the phone and Amazon could not bear that. HD voice call is good. But there other calls really so bad. Whatever may be the other features our prime job with phone is to talk right?.. For a normal usage battery is serving a day with the data alone in ON condition. Camera clarity is very average. You can better go for A50 fort better performance at low cost."
173,12 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"The camera is fine, but will work only if you have a good battery life! If you want to totally disconnect from using internet, opt for this phone! M40 has such a hopeless battery life, that you won't dare to keep the functions of sync on/ your phone brightness will be less than 40% , your mobile data will be off for most of the hours, you will stop listening music But Still....U Have to charge the phone twice in a day!!!! Better take any other phone or stick to your old one.. don't get carried away by the features, they all need a good battery life . Amazon doesn't allow you to exchange your piece with any other, they have their own conditions. Samsung will call for feedback, but will not give any solution since they belong to feedback department, and not the technical one!!"
174,28 June 2019,SHADAB AHMAD,"Im writing this review after using it for more than a week. Let's start from the display. Display Quality is cool and bright however missing AMOLED. Back Camera quality is superior even works better in low light. Front camera is poor. Battery backups is sufficient, for normal user it lasts upto 12 hour. I was expecting atleast 4000 MAh but its ok. Phone is handy. Very soft and smooth touch. On screen sound technology did not impress so much. Voice comes robotic and some time have to put effort while listening to caller. For Ganers: I tried PUBG, No Lag, supports high quality graphics hy default. So for Gamers Samsung M40 with 6 GB RAM and Snapdragon 675 processor, phone will not disappoint you. Overall the phone is worth buying it will not disappoint you."
175,23 June 2019,Buyer,"Overall a Good Product but it have few cons also:-
Pros:-
1).Infinity O display
2).Gives premium feel in hand by its look and design
3).Screen Sound Technology
4).Type C Earphone provided in Box
5).Camera quality is Good

Cons:-
1).No Amoled Display
2).Battery is only 3500 mah capacity
3).No mp3 Jack"
176,15 September 2019,Sidra,"Initially, I was quite happy with the looks and performance. The camera was not that great, but it just did my job.
The back of the phone is extremely susceptive to scratches. So its never been out of the cover.

11/09/2019. (Just after 2 months from buying):
This annoying notification started appearing (see attached images), the earphone stopped working and the screen wouldn't lock. The display was on full time draining the battery. It seemed like some issue with the Type C port. So I gave it to the service center.

14/09/2019
The day I received it back from the service center, the same issue started occurring again.
Going to try my luck again with the service center. Will update it soon.

15/09/2019
Okay so resetting the phone solved the issue.

17/09/2019
The phone stopped charging. Gave it to the service center again.

25/09/2019
So these guys wrote someone else number on my service documents, and I didn't even get the call that my phone is repaired. As soon as I reached home and connected my phone to my pc, the same issue started again. Earphones not working. Thank you samsung

What was my fault in all of this? Nothing.
Also, the guys at the service center said that there were similar issues with other devices as well. So be careful if you are thinking of making the purchase. I would suggest better go with Redmi K20. Or just something else but not Samsung."
177,14 August 2019,Kamal Chandar,"Likes -
1. Less Weight
2. Fast charging
3. Dolby Audio in headphones
4. Good clarity in camera
Dislikes -
1. Receiver is not visible like other devices. So need to change the positions of keeping the phone in your ears then and there.
2. Heats very much. If you play games mobile gets heated very much. Its too too much heat. Even if you open camera it is getting heated.
3. When u open camera and u receive a call, after u cut the call the screen gets flickered multiple times."
178,10 July 2019,Dalip Kumar,"Display stopped working after 14days, visited service center & after keeping phone for one day they replaced display, on testing found mic & phone vibration are not working. They replaced mic too. It didn't help, phone was still not responding as normal. Now they are suspecting issues with motherboard. I asked what is left their to replace, & requested for replacement which they denied saying as per policy they can't replace phone age 14days above.
I'm fighting with their service executives on call & on social platforms like Twitter.
This is turning into a nightmare. Worst decision by investing on Samsung phone, worst quality, pathetic service.
#SayNoToSamsung"
179,10 August 2019,Prosenjit Ghosh,"Good phone with nice features. Camera quality is fantastic. Fingerprint sensor is working very fast. The battery took about 1 hrs time to get fully charged and has good battery life of more than 1 day.
Con: the hybrid sim slot. Either you can keep the second sim or you can keep the sd card. You cannot have both together like A50. But as this phone comes with 128 GB internal memory so perhaps you might not need the external memory.
But if you need both the sim and the external memory card, then this phone is not for you."
180,2 August 2019,Franky Maky,The battery drains faster. You cant even imagine how rapidly it drains your phone's battery. There is a heating problem as well. Camera flicker in slow motion mode under yhe light. Camera quality is not that good. Screen is awesome no doubt. Touch is superb as well. The on screen voice feature is not good at all. It sounds like buzzing a fly on your ear. There is an echo of the sound over the call. Even M30 is far better than M40 in terms of battery and other performance metrics. Requested for return on the very first day.
181,23 June 2019,Animesh,"Awesome product.
The Smartphone is very smooth and fast.
Display is super.
Performance of this M40 with snapdragon 675 processor is very smooth in comparison to exynos processor used by samsung phone.
Camera quality is amazing.
Phone speaker is loud and sufficient for watching videos.
My criteria to buy this phone was performance and I'll give 5 out of 5.

Don't bother about 3.5 mm jack and amoled screen, they are nothing in comparison of features of this phone.

Go for this manufactured in India smartphone, you wont feel disappointed."

But I really liked the phone and I wished that they provide me a replacement ,which didn't happen so had to return. That technician told me that 60% of Samsung phones are coming out with manufacturing defects and that made to skip buying any Samsung phone. Phone perse is very dashing and cool looking .Perfomance and camera are decent too . Sufficient for the price range.But check thoroughly for for any manufacturing defects soon after you buy."

185,4 August 2019,Tanushree K Mehta,"the phone is good overall minus the camera
PROS
1. Fingerprint is spot on. Good Read with cover or without cover. you can set your fingerprints in like 5 seconds. its that fast
2. Phone's Speed is good for apps and games.
3. Charges fast and runs whole day with regular social media and work
4. Interesting Earpiece for calls which is hidden behind the screen. Not Great but good.

CONS (This Matters)
1. Camera is the worst. Focus Lags big Time. Moving objects are always blurred. Selfie Camera is still fine but that is mostly because you are in control and you tend to pause during your own click.
2. Focus in Low Light will make you Cry every time.
3. All the Flagship stickers and effects from Samsung are missing.

If you can ignore the camera then the phone is good looking and decent phone from samsung. But sad to say there are many better options in the market."
186,24 June 2019,Dr. Abhinav Shreeram,"The first look of this phone is awsome. A well balanced phone by samsung at this price range. But its not competitive. The only reason I bought it that I didn't want to go for Chinese brands.
Display is awesome but not as clear as amoled. The snapdragon provides the swiftness like butter. No overheating issue infact no heating at all. Battery is average. 100% battery with 20 hrs of general use had 30% remaining at the end. No fast draining. Type C earphones sounds awsome. The Dolby Atmos adjusts sound very well. Camera is average but that's not the problem for me cuz I haven't bought it for camera.
Overall if you want to have something with a good brand name. This is the device for you."
187,The manufacturer commented on the review below,worldsofwonder,"Hello Friends this is a real review about the phone if you want you can call me and verify at 09811023300 Its only 4 days i have been using this phone and have the following issue as i am surprised to see Samsung launched phone with so many flaws..As these are the manufacturing defect of the phone and today my 10 years loyalty have gone 0 for samsung..

Please find the issues below..
1. Phone earpiece - you cannot listen to the caller clearly as the speaker is inbuilt so the voice is getting echo as well if you are standing outside roadside then for sure you cannot listen to the caller if its a traffic on road.
2. No separate light sensor seems it is in inbuilt camera so it senses very late. If you pickup the phone in the night to see time your eyes will burn as the display is at highest brightness then suddenly sensor senses and lowers the brightness.
3. the finger print sensor is useless. It only senses when the display is on. If you put your finger on sensor then it wont wake up phone.
4. Sometimes you click on any voice note it will play in earpiece rater then speaker and till the time voice note finishes you wont be able to click anywhere else.
5. Again the sensor now if you call someone and put the phone on ear the screen light closes and if the call gets connected its well and good and if it wont then you cannot call again bcoz the light sensor wont switch on the display so you need to press the power button to get the display and then disconnect and redial.

Guys the above reviews are verified on one more unit of Samsung M40 only and i am really sorry for Samsung bcoz this Defective product launch shows Samsung is over confident about their products and their customers. Not a big deal soon some brand will capture their market like they captured Nokia before if they will do few more launches like this.

My 20k went on a toss. I have offered my phone for reselling but i cant hide the issues if i m selling my phone to any phone thats why no buyer in my known."
188,The manufacturer commented on the review below,monu k,Fornt camera is not good and back camera is good but i cant play pubgi game in this mobile but i am very unstisried this producet but look is awsome
189,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"I bought this phone from Amazon I Bought Samsung Galaxy M10 for my wife and Samsung Galaxy M30 for my brother and experience of both phones was very good.
I bought Samsung Galaxy M40 for myself on 16th of July but thinking that this phone is premium phone but when I used this phone I experienced that it heats up after 5 minutes of use. I reported the issue to Amazon they advised me to do factory reset and update software but no use after repeated problem I again contacted amazon and agent asked me to run Blancco application phone is actually getting heat up but application shows temperature is 35°C which is in acceptable range. He also accepted that phone is heating but he said i can only write/report only result shown by application CPU_Z which he installed on my phone to check the temperature. Also amzon sent their executive to check the phone physically he also observed that phone heats up but application shows temperature. There is no use of sending any one if he can't report actual facts which can be felt not measured.

I felt cheated after buying this phone which is having manufacturing defect and Amazon's return policy don't help in solving customer pain.

Very bad experience with this phone......

Totally waste of money I feel cheated with a defected phone.

Amazon/Samsung should understand that not all products manufactured are defected only few products get out of factory with manufacturing defect . For defect of manufacturing customer shouldn't suffer pain or economic loss .

Is it fault of customer if product is defective?

Thanks & Regards to Amazon and Samsung for selling me defective product and making me feel cheated.

190,25 June 2019,BHANU PRAKASH,I'm satisfied with the performance of mobile and feels more premium finish. Battery capacity should be increased. Picture quality is above average. Slight temperature increase is observed which is normal in all mobiles while gaming or running huge number of apps.
191,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Mayur K.,"Cons:
1. Battery life is too short
2. Voice quality is not good since there is no earpiece, you can feel the vibrations in screen during calls. Too bad
3. Poor camera especially front, can't believe it's Samsung (fixed after OTA update)
4. Fast charging is a joke compared to competition.
5. Older processor (675)
6. Slower fingerprint unlock
6. Adaptive display does not work efficiently, there is much of a delay.

Overall all cost cutting by Samsung except the display. Even charger cable is shorter.
I had Oppo F9 pro (2018) and M40 is clearly a downgrade from Oppo's older and cheaper model. Shame on Samsung.
Not satisfied. And the best part is, you cannot return!"
192,9 July 2019,Garima Asthana,"I liked the phone, it has all the features I wished right from RAM, storage, camera and battery but handset I received was defective, the sound icon would pop up on screen at irregular intervals from nowhere like ghost and pause whatever you r doing.
Ordered for replacement and the replaced product had the same issue. Thus, had to return it and thanks to Amazon it was facilitated easily."
193,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Dilip Kumar S R,"Worst product from Samsung. Basic use of phone is call, in this phone incoming call is not clear, you can not able hear other person voice because of this on screen sound technology. Also phone vibrates during the call ????

I tried all options, increased call volume, did tried in safe mode, did the setting reset, did changed the sim, finally did the factory reset. But issue still remains.

It is not practical to always use headset or use speaker mode for calls.

On top of these, Amazon is not supporting for the exchange of different model as this has this performance/ feature issue. Amazon can only replace which won't help in this case."
194,14 September 2019,AB,"Everything is good except light poor Battery performance. Charger not performing as a fast charger.

Camera quality very good,

Speaker Sound mode quality is better than on screen technology sound mode,

in rush area the on screen sound not performing in a quality full manner.

However, Rest performance is very good in such rate and incomparison with some famous China set's.

Overall the performance is very cool. Like a branded set."
195,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Sukhvendra Singh,"Camera quality is very poor, bad camera, not satisfied with camera qualtiy."
196,15 September 2019,Prateek PRT,"This is my tenth smart phone and believe me nothing tops this one.
I see a smart phone as an investment to my work and private life balance. A smart phone should be fast enough to gather all the information one could grab in seconds.
With 6GB RAM this phone runs on ice. Like I said balance is important. The screen size it offers provides the ease and quick juncture for your thirst for work done.
Lets pin down goddies-
1. Camera- stunning
2. Touch - even gloves on you can slide with left hand
3. Resolution- only iPhone matches it
4. Apps compatibility- all apps like every app
5. Screen size- covers every corner
6. Face lock- even slight gesture is enough. You can unlock with your specs on.
7. Sound - Cristal clear

I think it's a GO GO Product.

Only flaw I found is absence of 3.1 audio jack but who cares as this is ""THE"" Bluetooth age."
197,9 July 2019,Thought Works,"1. The Phone is heating up very badly
2. The Voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible.
3. These are very basic and important issues which we do not expect from a Brand like Samsung
4. As Amazon has 10 days replacement, they are not replacing this product with any other phone. As these basic issues will be throughout in this phone. Really disappointed with Amazon."
198,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Shambhu Kumar Singh,Battery back up is too low to use for any professionals..even less than 2 year old phone..hence not recommended to buy
199,2 July 2019,Sundeep Kashyap,"I bought a Samsung Galaxy M40 on June 20, 2019. I have received the product within a week, i.e on June 26, 2019. Thanks to amazing delivery from Amazon. I love the phone's minimalistic interface. The processor is smooth like butter. It is damn fast. Unlike some negative reviews as I found here, I never faced any heating issues. Further, I never faced any issues while talking to others over the phone. The on-screen sound technology works perfectly. The camera quality is decent. The sound quality is tremendous. Connect your earphone or get it to connect with any Bluetooth headphone and switch on the Dolby Atmos and see the magic. But......the only problem which I have faced in this phone is the BATTERY. Gosh.....it drains like anything.....besides this, this phone is good in this price range."
200,29 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"A weeks usage.

Pros
1) Finger print is good.
2) Battery is good lasts for more than a day in normal usage.
3) normal cam is good.
4) punch hole display looks premium.
5) All applications will load fast and there is no lagging with multiple apps.
6) system loads very fast and user friendly.

Cons.
1) Face recognition is slow. Some times dosent recognize at all.
2) Camera quality is bad I didn't like it personally.
3) Display Super amoled would be good .
4) Plastic body looks cheap and glossy finish leaves lots of fingerprints.
5) the volume button and power key looks cheap and don't know how long it will hold ."
201,21 June 2019,Vishvas Soni,"Here is my opinion about s galaxy m40 after 2 days of use
Type C headphone port not working
#With this phone if u r using continuously, u have to charge 2-3 times in a day
Camera very good 5/5
Display looks 3d curved 4.5/5
Fast changing 4.5/5
Battery draining also very fast 2/5"
202,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Dhruv Agarwal,"Useless phone useless camera
Samsung has deteriorated its quality over the years.
I was using Vivo V9 and had high hopes with this phone but feel disappointed."
203,24 June 2019,Akash Gupta,"Amazon is not even ready to take return and replace with any other phone.

Cons:
Main Drawback of M40 is its camera quality. Photos look like blurred.
I had used J7 and on8 in past this phone has not pictures quality like them.
Photos look like they are clicked from a low range mobile.
On screen speaker is causing problem in audio quality.
Memory is 128 GB but I can see 26 GB is already reserved.
Earphone is C-type so it can not be used with other 3.5 MM jacks.

Pros:
Speed and battery life is good and satisfactory.
6 GB Ram and 128 GB space is in this range is satisfactory.
Phone does not heat up like other Samsung phone does while charging and using mobile data."
204,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ankit,"Only design rating is 5 star, Camera quality is 3rd class, i want return this device and I want my money back , in Rs.13999 redmi note 7 pro is best camera"
205,25 June 2019,K Peddi Raju,Honestly phone is very cute. With o infinity display Galaxy M40 is a master piece at that price also with snap dragon 675 soc. However a small pinch of pain pervades me due to hybrid slot which is not a Samsung design. I am missing SD card. Also I am missing s Amoled display. Small problem is with call receiving where voice is low and echoing. I hope samsung will fix those minor issues. Other wise phone touch is fantastic. Speed is good. No heating issues. Battery life is good for complete day usage. Overall I give 4 stars. Finger print is fast enough. Camera quality is good.
206,10 July 2019,Shibu I.,"Writing review after 3 weeks of usage. First of all I'm not a Samsung fan or neither Xiaomi fan. This is my honest review...

DESIGN : Design in pretty good and phone look premium in hands. And the gradient effect on the backside is really beautiful.

SCREEN : It doesn't have super amoled screen. It is its biggest drawback. But TFT is fine...Just fine

BATTERY : 3500 mah is not so low...Average user gets 8hr screen-on-time...

PERFORMANCE & GAMING : This is the best part of this phone...I didn't felt any lag switching between apps or opening them...6GB ram is more than enough for multitasking and heavy gaming. I also played PUBG, ASPHALT 9, FORTNITE and ran without any noticeable framedrops.

SOFTWARE & UI : Phone comes out of the box with Android 9.0.0 and One UI 1.1. I of the best thing happened to Samsung devices is the new OneUI. It is very simple, neat & Ad free. One UI also has some unique features compared to other UI.

CAMERA : Even Samsung clam it has 32MP sensor image, quality is not so good...Images are not sharp enough...Front camera is ok...And video recording is just fine in 1080p at 60fps...It can also rec upto 2160p

Headphone jack is missing. But I don't care cuz today we mostly have Bluetooth speakers and headphones.

Value for Money : Unlike other cheep chinese smartphones, It have good built quality and Ad free UI. One of the main reason why I didn't go with Redmi Phones is it have a lot of boltware and ads. Trust me that is ridiculous. And if the Camera problem solve with the future updates, you don't have to regret for paying 20k."
207,23 September 2019,Vimala,"This phone stopped working just within a month (in fact 14 days ) of buying, it went dead wouldn't re-charge or start. I'm still running around to get it fixed. Not sure if I'm the unlucky one but do ensure you get the insurance when buying online otherwise no one cares post-purchase, you are just on your own. Realized its better to buy locally, at least you know who to go back in case of issues."
208,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Camera front & back is worst, its both cameras are like old samsung s dous series phones.
If u go to service center they will tell just do software update & will return you your phone & will say your camera is perfect & having no problem.

So guys pls don’t buy this phone for god shakes & i have wasted by money buy this faltu phone."
209,The manufacturer commented on the review below,navneet,"Pros:

Only good thing about phone is its premium look and display
Cons:

1) Worst in call sound quality, very irritating to have conversation on call which should be the basic most important thing for any phone

2) Battery draining too fast on idle phone

3) selfie camera picture quality is not good and having artificial effects"
210,27 July 2019,saurabh,"fingerprint reader working good can be use for single handed operation.
Face unlocks also working fine.
Camera quality is fair, but we can find good cameras in phone in this prize range.
Phone hearing speaker is not good, screen vibrates and get heated on call.
Battery life is average
Major drawback is of headphones with no 3.5mm jack. you just cant use headphones while charging.
for better use we can use BT headphones.
For gaming phone is good, works good with 6gb/ 128gb.
Best thing i liked about this phone is LOOKS, really nice looking."
211,8 July 2019,rakesh saini,"After using 3 days I am writing this review..
Fingerprint sensor is little bit high..it suppose to be little bit down, so can reach easily.
Camera quality is not what I expected, I saw photos taken by redmi not 7 pro, far better this.
Battery life is also not what I expected, can not run full day, even without browsing whole day..need charge again.
After 1 month, its screen starting giving problem..while working, its touch stop working, to work it again, need to switch screen off than start again.. I recommend not to buy this phone.."
212,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Lakki,I have got defective piece that headset speaker is very bad sound and light sensor not working properly very sad with this product and I have raise for return for genuine product but not getting solution quickly.......really very bad service given by amazon very disappointing that when i complain within a week that mobile is defective auto brightness and headset speaker not working then they have taken a inspection service and inspection executive also accepted that mobile really defective should be replaced and i am waiting from last 3 days for change but not able to talk customer care neither replacement status getting very disappointing......😭😭😭😭
213,28 June 2019,Niki,"Excellent phone for an excellent price. Infinity O display is phenomenal - wide and good looking screen, not really missing out on the AMOLED. Encorporates the Samsung ""glance"" feature on the lock screen, which is pretty cool. Super fast processor, battery life is good. Camera is really decent, - pretty good quality photos in terms of clarity and depth. Can't complain. Can't get a better phone of this quality, for this price bracket in my opinion. Type c earphones and charger provided in box. Only negative would the the plasticy back, but the color and overall feel compensate for that."
214,28 June 2019,KarBar,"Punch Hole Display + SD 675 + 6 GB RAM and 128 GB Storage and many more latest technology in single mobile=M40

I am a blind follower of Samsung Mobile, purchased M40 on it first sale. After 9 days of uses, I am sharing my review so that other can make their decision. Guys it’s my personal experience only.
A very big O M G to Samsung Galaxy M40
• Its Punch Hole display and slim (7.9 MM) design gives it premium look.
• It’s true it does not have Super Amoled Display but definitely you will not miss it because it has awesome PLS TFT display with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.
• SD 675 makes it fast, can play GAME without any lag.
• Everyone love selfie and clicking moment, I am fully satisfied with Main Camera (32, 8 and 5) MP and Selfie Camera 16 MP.
• It has dual band WiFi, latest Bluetooth V 5.0 and NFC (NFC found in flagship mobile only).
• It has all necessary sensors with optimized, quick responsive fingerprint sensor
The very latest technology used by Samsung in M40 is Screen to Sound Technology, yes guys M40 does not have earpiece speaker, it uses Screen to Sound technology. You can hear caller’s voice from its SCREEN only. Voice can be heard from any part of M40 display.
It has only 3500 mAh Battery, it’s good for normal uses.
Overall I’ll give 9 .5 out of 10
I am not professional reviewer, ignore mistakes.
Thanks"
215,29 July 2019,Abraham Jacob Kurialanickal,"Gorgeous looking Infinity-O display😍.

Sleek design and easy to hold in hand (recommend buying a case though cuz phone is a little bit slippery).

Would have preferred a speaker grille on top but under display speaker works just fine 👍.

Phone doesn't come with pre-installed screen protector so I recommend buying one.

Sad to see Samsung has removed 3.5mm headphone jack but they resolve the problem by providing Type-C earphones which sound really good.

Battery life has been good on this device although it's not the best out there. Fast charging is a great addition though.

The camera's on this device are great and the fact that we get a triple camera setup at this price is awesome.

The software experience has been great. It's safe to say that Samsung has really leveled up their game from TouchWiz which was a disaster.

The Snapdragon 675 coupled with 6GB of RAM has given silky smooth performance.

Even though people are saying that AMOLED is missing, it's not that big of an issue. The display looks really good with great colours. I assume Samsung dropped the AMOLED in order to reduce the overall price of the device.

Overall for ₹20k this is a phone that is unrivalled at its price range(except if u really care about the 3.5mm headphone jack)."
216,25 June 2019,Anirudh,"The screen is absolute beauty. Giving the infinity O display for a phone in this price point with snapdragon processor and a whooping 6gb ram the phone is simply amazing. Camera quality is good but with continuous shooting the device heats up. The fast charging also works well and with a full charge the phone survives until the evening with extensive use. The finish on the back is also a beauty, providing plastic back with glossy finish is the way to go for a modern phone. With all other features such as AR emojis, live focus and One UI makes the phone feel premium. The screen sound technology also works well and i have faced no difficulties in hearing. Though there is no headphone jack the earphones in the box are good, so no issues with that."
217,13 October 2019,Anurag Bagaria,"should not buy

1. the device hearing quality is too poor. the voice is cracking always and it is not audible. everytime I have to ask to repeat whatever is said.
2 ) the quality of body and color on it are not good as it started having scratches since inception inspite of handling it sophisticatedly
3) The amazon executive has visited and found the above problems to be correct and amazon offered me replacement but I would prefer a refund as i find from review section that most of the buyers have complain of about the similar hearing problem as described by me above. this model of phone suffers from inherent defect
this model should be withdrawn by samsung immediately.

after complaint being made the phone was replaced but to my utter shock the replaced handset is having the same hearing problem. I am sure that this model suffers from inherent/manufacturing defect."
218,29 June 2019,Vimal Kumar,"I have never owned a phone which costed more than 12k. So this phone with 6gb ram is like a beast to me.
Best part of the phone are:
1. It was very easy to incorporate all my files and app which I had in my previous phone. Took me around 5-10min.
2. The Design is lovely. Got the Midnight Blue, I had my doubts by looking at the picture in product page, but the looks and design are very elegant.
3. Rear Camera is awesome, Slow-mo was something that got me interested into this phone. This one has a super slow mo capture as well. The pricture quality is crisp and clear. Kudos to the front camera selfies as well. But I have experienced low light pixelated issue. Not sure if this is something setting related.
4. UI is Simple and Neat,....a lot to explore still.
5. I dont game on phone, with calls and youtube, the battery is up for a day and half easily.

So the only thing I found a bit lacky on this phone is the front camera selfie in low light. I took some selfies inside cinema theatre before movie. It was very pixelated.

Overall this a great phone to have for the configuration it has...…... at this price range."
219,25 June 2019,Shrishaila,"It's been just 4 months I bought this phone.. now phone got hanged and not getting switched on... just showing Samsung logo.. when I asked these people they said me to contact samsung people and when I go to service center they are denying it to claim the warranty because there is a dent on the edge of the phone.. but the issue is related to motherboard and it is a technical issue.. Please don't buy any Samsung phone.. They are making people fools..( due to one single scratch in the edge of the phone they are not claiming warranty )

Continuation
After all the above story I gave my mobile in the samsung service center on paid service..
These Samsung service people said me as expected the motherboard is corrupted due to intact damage so it needs to be changed(they said it costs around 10,500Rs).. I thought I can buy new one with some more extra money.. so I said them to not repair and I got it back... recently I watched YouTube and learned how to reset with keys.. my mobile got switched on.. and now I m writing the review with same phone..

CONCLUSION:
1.If you buy mobile buy hard case.
2. Make sure you won't put any scratch on mobile to avail warranty.
3. If ur mobile is not under warranty don't go to Samsung service center because they are literally looting people.. According to my experience I am saying this.
4. As I saw many people were crying in the service center to pay the service fees which will be higher than your mobiles present cost.
5. And few of them were fighting with them who have good backgrounds.
6. A people like Us(middle class) will come home without complaining anyone."
220,25 July 2019,Pritam Gangopadhyay,"The mobile looks quite good externally with the glossy look on it, however there were few things that disappointed me a little.

*The Battery Life: the power drains like anything, and the longest it lasts is-
1. 6-8 hours (If you're watching videos)
2. 4-5 hours(if you play continuous game)
3. 18-20 hours (if you just browse the phone, No Data but just Calls and Texts

*Camera quality
1. Looks more like a 16mp camera that says 32mp, not really great at all.
2. The newly added features are quite attracting but not so great.

Hardware:

So guys: If you have 2 sim cards and 1 SD card, then let me break the ice for you right away-
You can never use all the three together. The SD Card slot allows only either of them so either its the SD card or the Sim card.

Rest other things are quite fine according to me.

Thank"
221,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Syed NADEEM,"depressing non sense ear phones... doesnot goes good with high end games, poor battery backup,only one port for charging and earphones, hanged one time till now ... excellent camera , quite weighted, asthetically good. Value for money for 6gb ram and 128 gb space.
If you are not a high end gamer , this phone is worth buying for this price"
222,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ravindra Chinchole,"Honest Review,The phone has very good battery life.If you go for camera it is slightly average in home or in night but in day for outdoor it is very good.The processor is very good which helps a smooth gaming experience.For PUBG by default graphics is High.Overall its a very good phone but the price range is slightly high.And considering the specifications There is no Amoled display but if you applying a screen guard can resolve the issue.Camera Quality is Good.And one more thing which disappoints me and all of you is there is no 3.5mm jack and cant get an adapter for it with packing but you get a type c earphone with the product in box.And after all the trust issue is we can trist on Samsung than any other company.But if you want a popup camera rather than punch hole and a more good camera quality you can go with realms x also."
223,25 June 2019,Vinothkumar,"Phone looks good and very nice.

Battery not okay they should give 4000 or some good battery optimisation.

Display not bad while campring between amold and other LCD, this is not okay. Because we came across brand trust but now that is not there.

Performance it's okay mid range only.

Why Snapdragon processors while others (moto)are using Samsung processors?

And in my display bottom of navigation bar some light dark shadow is there inside display And inifnity O circle also having se dark shadow.
This is defect or design I'm not sure..

Phone is good but okay to this price. 20k they can give good quality phone"
224,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Very low and unclear voice comes when you receive a call. Screen vibrates a lot during calls which feels very uncomfortable on your ears. In a crowded place or in traffic, you cannot received calls without headphones. Even if your phone is connected on charging you have to receive call on speaker mode because there is no separate jack for charging.
Battery backup is very very very POOR. Keep your charger all the time with you. In performance, very little difference is there in comparison of M20. Samsung M20 is far better than this. And M20 is Rs. 9000 cheaper also. First time I faced this problem in a Samsung Phone."
225,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Pathetic camera!
The phone has a stunning display, excellent performance and an average batter but camera is the worst. Its not worth the money. I saw all reviews and expected camera to be average but reality is it is worse."
226,8 August 2019,JAGADEESH BABU NATTHA,"After usage of 40 days, below are my major finding:

Cons:
1. Very Very Wooooooooorst selfie cam
(attached the selfie cam pic & rear cam pic)
2. rear cam is ok, but NOT looks like 32 MP ouput
3. very sad & dissapointed that is not allowing any Samsung Fonts & NO Free fonts, all are paid fonts unlike regular samsung mobile series supports
4. average sound quality (on screen)

Pros:
1. Very good Battery
2. decent UI
3. no issues with performance"
227,20 August 2019,Ashique Kamal,"The new Samsung Galaxy m40 is a big failure.i ordered a brand new m40 phone via Amazon before 4days.the product is utter failure in performance,camera and vedio qality.the sound system of the phone is not working both speaker and headphones. I never expected a phone like this from Samsung.i don't know wether the complaint is only for my phone or the other m40 phones.anyway i am taking action to replace the item via Amazon."
228,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Rajesh Panchal,"If you want to waste your 20k then go for this worst phone.

Very disappointed with the this phone, samsung must grow up and stop fooling customers with such third class phones,
They says camera is 32MP + 8MP + 5MP triple rear camera but its not ever close to 2MP, even phone worth 5k has good camera than this stupid samsung M40.

The support team is also seems cheating, one person is arranging return and other is saying we don't have return policy.

Feeling cheated by amazon.
Don't buy this phone even for 5k also don't buy products from amazon."
229,28 June 2019,Bharat Sharma,"For starters, this phone is absolutely beautiful. Sometimes I unlock the screen just to get a look at how astonishingly sharp and beautiful it is, yes, even without an AMOLED display. It feels like a premium device when you hold it and the back glossy finish does not look like plastic at all.

The camera is really subpar. If your priority is camera, go for a different phone. Both selfie camera and back camera could have been much better. They have the numbers, just not the performance.

In terms of speed, I have experienced no lag after a week of usage. Some heavy games like Asphalt 9 might feel glitchy but that goes away quickly.

The fingerprint sensor is a breeze. Although the placing felt uncomfortable in the beginning, I have got used to it now.

I personally prefer the punch hole camera over the centre placed water drop camera. There is some black bleeding around the camera but the fact that it's in the corner makes the phone stand out when compared to other bezel less displays. It's a matter of preference in the end.

The battery life is average. It lasts for a day with regular usage but drains a lot quicker if you're glued to your phone all day like me.

The 3.5mm jack is a non-issue because the phone comes with fast charging.

In essence, I am happy with this phone for now. The camera and battery are just average but the beauty of the phone compensates for it. And the UI is a smooth experience. My opinion: if your budget is 20k, go for it."
230,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Riteshraj Sharma,"Camera is worst, phone vibrates while talking with other person voice. There is no fast charging in this phone , in complete 1 hour phone get charged from 18% to 51% only.
Network issue, my number remains not reachable many times. Sound issue, phone does not rings on calls many times, I have checked all the settings.
Need replacement."
231,18 July 2019,Shresth yadav,"This phone is not upto to fulfill your requirements. Like phone camera is not good as told 32mega pixel doesn't give good photos and its front camera 16 mega pixel is also not it doesn't give clear photos....
But about speed ram 6gb with 128gb RoM give best speed to phone ...it feel u good ..and its design and screen will take ur attention....and others Al's 2. Camera doesn't have AI features And Phone doesn't have eye comfort or blue light cutt type features.....but may be it will added
And one new thing I will going to experience like
Its receiver speaker is in build in screen only and .....may more features
Fingers print sensor is not good
Battery life average"
232,23 June 2019,Dhanya,"Phone Looking stunning with seawater blue color. Smooth performance. Rear Camera quality was too good.front too. But one dispointing think is heating. If use ur phone continuously (camera), heating problem occurred."
233,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Balaji Vikram,"Received 3days after ordering and it was Defective. Want immediate replacement or refund.

Worst camera, ear piece and battery"
234,17 July 2019,Shiv,"One of the worst product of this century. Don't buy it. Samsung is outwitting Indian consumer. If you are using two micro SIM, you can't insert micro SD card. Only Indian sim card can be used. Sim slot is made of plastic. You have to use only Samsung chargers or you have to carry the charger in your tours. Camera is worst . Old fashioned screenshot capturing system, i.e push sound and on-off button to capture screen shot .
Samsung's mentality is primitive style. They still thinks that they are pioneer, lol.
Don't buy it even if they offer at 50% discount."
235,28 August 2019,Shrinivas Andhare,"Highly disappointed after the charging socket in the phone malfunctioned within a month of useage. It was repaired under warranty by Samsung Service centre.
Such issues are not expected from a brand like Samsung which is known for its robust hardware.
Barring this malfunction, the phone is very good. Especially the display and camera. Phone has a premium look. Would have given 5 stars if I had not faced hardware issue."
236,25 July 2019,Nekul Varghese,"Battery life is the biggest concern of this smartphone. Battery gets drained even when not in use. My brother-in-law got so fed up with it, that he took it to a local mobile shop and got it exchanged for Oppo F11. I don't blame him, I completely get it. But what I don't get is, instead of investing in good next generation battery technologies like, Tesla for example, why does these smartphone companies are going the Fast charging ways. Makes no sense to me. What is these use of all these Fast charging if battery keeps on draining so quickly? Anyway, all who intend to buy this smartphone, beware of this issue."
237,22 June 2019,Soumyajit,"After two days,
Phone looks fabulous.
Build quality very very good.
Speed superb.
Camera very good but front camera has on screen flash which is bad.

Samsung has done so far but did compromise with battery. Battery drains fast though it stays a day long on very normal usage. Though it got fast charging , very very fast charging."
238,21 August 2019,Aditya Chatterjee,"I have been using the phone for arounda month now. Here are the Pros and cons

Pros-
1) Look - the Blue colour of this phone is beautiful and looks good in one's hand.

2) Camera - the camera takes good pics in the day light in outdoor conditions

3) Battery Backup - The phone runs for an entire day with Mobile data on and normal usage.

Cons
1) Slippery - The phone tends to slip a bit from my hand.

2) Low light Camera - The camera doesnt give good pics in the low light or night light."
239,26 June 2019,mangesh_soni,"Worst phone by Samsung by far..and so is the endorsement by Amazon.. there is no earphone/speaker... so screen is the earphone..it vibrates everytime the other guy speaks..build quality is worse than the worst Chinese phone. No proper response from Amazon on return. Please don't buy the phone and trust ""Amazon Exclusive"" again"
240,18 August 2019,Dheena,"Very very poor camera
Touch response rate is very poor
Display clarity is very good even thought its not Amoled
OS NICE
very worst processor for 20k
Phone is considerably average speed only
Size and form factor good
Finger print reader very slow
Not worth for money
But I bought this phone because it has got very less SAR ratings @ 0.2 and I feel that's more than good reason for me to buy this phone .
But if you are ok with 1.5 SAR ratings plus then prefer Redmi K20 or POCO or Redmi note 7 pro @ this budget"
241,30 August 2019,Nripendra,"Its a great budget phone.
1. Biggest plus, it stores your data in india and s korea. Not the other country where your personal data is venerable.
2. Its gives you google cloud storage and not like Chinese phones which pushes you to use their servers.
3. Changing phone you dont lose your data. This was difficult with Chinese phones.
4. Camera, battery, screen quality, voice clearity etc are all good.

Con
1. Fingerprint sensor is slow.
2. Processor is not latest but ok. No other complaints."
242,13 July 2019,Harsh Vardhan Jain,"About Battery life I given 4 rating because of 3500 mah. According to me it should be 4000 mah atleast. Apart from that all features is nice. Phone is really impressive with the all new features like punch hole camera in display, triple camera with 32-8-5 is awesome and screen sound technology. Fingerprint is so fast, display is really vivid, look is really premium which makes me feel happy while looking into it. About processor is also so fast with 675 snap dragon. I think this phone provided all features which u need. Please guys buy this phone it will really make u happy after buying."
243,The manufacturer commented on the review below,shub,"Pros
1) awesome look, punch hole camera is giving a fabulous looks.
2)- on screen sound.

Cons
1)- camera quality's suck,night mode is missing.(download Google.cam apk for best result)
2) - screen is not super amoled or amoled, just TFT. No gorilla protection.
3)- no led notifications light
4) faceunlock is not working properly.
5)-sim tray is hybrid.
6)- backpanel is of poly not glass.
7) battery drain too fast.
8) speaker don't have loud sound and bass.

Cost is too high for this phone , A50 is better."
244,22 June 2019,Ratheesh,"Display quality, Camera quality, Internal Memory, Processor quality, RAM, Face unlock facility (which works great). You name and it is there in best possible specification in this phone. I cannot expect more in Rs. 20,000.

Better than any other phone of any company in this price range.

Battery could have been better but human wishes never end. Still I think power consumption of this phone is low. I spend only 60% from morning to evening with brightest display settings. No need to think twice if you plan to buy this phone. I am happy that I decided to buy it."
245,25 June 2019,Kaustubh,"This one of best phone in this price range
Infinity O is superb and glasstic panel in back is look like glass and gives premium feeling in hand
Snapdragon 675 speed wow ,and awesome ram management done by Samsung
Triple rear camera gives best pics in low light and in sunlight
Front selfie camera is awesome too
For gaming this phone is superb
Battery life is also good"
246,1 July 2019,Pragati Kadam,"So I've been using this for just over a week now.

Pro:

Cost: best cost effective option in this range and features provided, unreal.

Rather going to Vivo or Redmi, I suggest to go for M40.

2. Performance: 6GB RAM and inbuilt memory shows the difference in performance. Even 675 Sanpdragon is fast, not fast like S series or OnePlus but c'mon in this price range this is the best you could expect.

3. Super Slow Mo: I'm just fan of this super slow mo

4. Face recognition and Fingure sensor: like its mention in any promo, it is next level and it works like charm even in low light (face recognition)

5. Fast charge: it is actually super fast charge, with highest setting and constant use of phone I need to charge it at least 2 times but it's ready to use in no time

6. Also, I love the fact that handsfree are provided with this phone.

Cons

1. Phone heating: if you play game, phone would heat up

2. Camera isn't THAT great in low light

3. Phone is slippery so need to be very careful as cases and screen protection isn't available (quality).

Overall, it's good phone with super results and for budget smartphone if you're confused, go for this phone without second thought much better compared to your Vivos and Oppps or Redmi."
247,2 July 2019,Ashok,"The technical team of Samsung says it doesn't support fast charging and its average battery life is 6hr only.Once if you buy this item you can't return it.Fast charging is not much effective, it takes almost 2hr to fill the battery. Camera quality is not good. Some apps like jio cinema doesnt support full screen mode.Overal Look is nice , performance is also good. In the case of network signal ,it is not upto the standard for providing. Touch screen is verry sensitive and good."
248,31 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Samsung M40 is supposed to be the unique product considering samsung for first time offering Sanpdragon processor. However it's a complete let down.

Battery backup is extremely bad , a fully charged phone even only gives more battery backup of 7 hrs ( calls and browsing only no games). The phone processing speed is quite slow and lags continuously. Camera also not good enough to take sharp contrasting pics.

Call volume at max and speaker is very low even at full volume."
249,28 July 2019,Mohan Darlami,"Overall amazing product and amazing service👍
Mobile was really looking very adorable and great👍
The mobile display is awesome👍 camera quality is good👍 but, one thing in camera what i dislike👎 samsung galaxy m40 have no portrait option that's one i don't like.. But, mobile was really looking cool.
And last samsung galaxy m40 touch screen was really soo smoth👍"
250,25 June 2019,Dnyaneshwar Gaikwad,"Voice quality is bad, WiFi disconnects automatically in between. Don't buy it."
251,27 June 2019,Trusted Customer,"First of all, I have to mention about the look of the set and it's beautiful. It's stunningly beautiful. The full display even though a bit long does not seem difficult to use and is very much handy. The fingerprint sensor in the back is super fast and responds an instant. I've been using it for a week and the battery life is pretty amazing too. It easily gives 24 hours of usage before the next charge. The camera quality is pretty amazing too. With a triple camera setup I was able to click many good pics and the front camera is very good as well. It has some minor drawbacks such as it has no gesture for taking a screenshot which is common in other phones now. But it can be overlooked. Great phone. Loving it."
252,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"The most pertinent issue I'm facing is with the quality of Phone calls. It strains my ear to actually listen to what the other person is trying to communicate. Moreover, its impossible to have a conversation when outdoors.

The other issue is with the quality of camera, both front and rear. The front camera clicks worse pictures than a sub standard 10k phone. The rear camera clicks the dullest possible pictures in every lighting condition. Moreover, the rear camera does neither captures details nor does it focus."
253,7 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Pros:
1.camera, especially back camera.
2. Screen quality is good
3. Sound quality with in box earphone is wow.
4. Phone built is decent
5. Screen touch is flawless.

Cons:
1.phone is locked and not compatible with other countries SIM card.
2.Battery life of worst.. 3500mAH is useless
Many apps keeps on crashing..
3. Fingerprint reader many times doesn't read the fingerprint.
4. SAMSUNG UX is bad. To delete one SmS user has to click at least 3 buttons.. many options are difficult to locate, especially in settings."
254,27 June 2019,Ankita m,"This budget smartphone is faster at performance. I have ordered sea water blue color and its beautiful- looks 10 on 10. The only unexpected thing is its front camera- its average. So, if you are not a 'selfie person', get this phone.
I have shared 3 images. Image of leaves are taken by rear camera. The teddy holding m4o box is taken by rear camera. Another pic of teddy without box is taken with selfie camera.
Its finger print reader is swift- you just have to swipe your index finger on the reader and you are done.
Sensors are awesome.
Screen view lock system feature is the best, especially when you have a toddler on your side to poke on screen.

It is still good and you can buy it without doubt to capture most beautiful moments of life.
few things the team can fix-
1.There is noway going back when you use few apps. Make going back easy.
2. Navigation issue- please fix this issue. I cannot navigate to my app notifications when i click on them."

But battery should be some more better"
256,12 July 2019,srikanth,"Pro's:

257,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"*Battery drains very fast even using basic App's , 3500Mah drains 4 to 5 hrs max .if ur a gamer or watch more videos in online 2hrs or 3hrs hrs max for this capacity.
*it heats more while playing games ,watching online vedios .
*only one port for both charging & earphones.
*camera is not upto the mark ,
*front camera is worst looks like 5 mpl photos blurred images. Display of this is very bad.
* Slow unlock face recognition, Face unlock is not

258,26 June 2019,Nagaraj,"I am writing this review after using 5days:
Pros:
1. Punch hole at this price segment
2. 6Gb ram and 128gb storage
3. Getting premium quality feeling some times because of display..
4. Back camera - Not bad
5. Wide angle shots - good

Cons:
1. In display speaker - it acceptable only if u use inside home or office... but if u r using outside(noisy environment)even in the full volume u will not get what they are saying.... whole phone getting vibration if u use full volume bcas of in display speaker...
2. Battery life - YouTube, Twitter, Instagram.. and voice call each 30mins.. this is my basic usage for this at evening I m endup with 40%(10am to 8pm)...
3. Fast changing????? - from 20% to 100% it is taking more than 100mins(around 2hrs)...
4. Polycarbonate back panel
5. Front camera - after taking the image I felt like some one painted in my face(Not natural)..."

1. Speaker is very noisy.
2. Software is getting hang again and again.
3. Phone state rebooting very frequently.
4. Device is getting heating within few minutes only while on call.
5. Amazon is not helping after selling product.
6. Technical team visit 3 times with in 1 week after buying this phone and confirm problem with phone, but still Amazon is helpless to arrange refund.

7. Amazon is only supporting seller Instead of customer to help out feom situation, because they only have policy for seller benefits not for customer benefits."
262,22 August 2019,Adi,"The screen sound technology sounds like there is speaker behind the screen and calls are not that clear compared to normal phones with speaker on top.
I didn't find touch to be that grade. Sometime had to tap twice. Adaptive brightness is not smooth, it takes a while to adjust.
Highest volume is not that loud compared to other phones."

264,8 August 2019,Abhay G.,"Phone stopped charging port after purchase of just15 days... Went to samsung service centre but no help.
They said they dont have spare parts for it.
It has been almost 3 weeks now but still no spare parts no service. Frustrated and helpless I waited for a month or it to get repairs. After working for two days the charging port stopped working again. I am left helpless for a week again as the people they employ in service centres of Samsung are such professionals. To all the people looking for buying it please don’t, it’s a bad investment to get a Samsung phone and a headache of a lifetime. I am finally back to using my old phone and the new Samsung phone I bought is sitting like a duck in a box in my drawer like the professionals they employ in there service centre. Save your money and time. Find some other phone but never Samsung M40 again . Frustrated!!!!"
265,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Mohammad Juned,"Camera is 32MP,but its working like 8MP of my redmi 2 prime...it is 11nm base but after that the battery draining so fast.
Phone has heating issue.Phone heats a lot while using.
On screen speaker technology is not working properly.The sound of on screen speaker is really bad....in crowded place you can't hear a single word from other side,this is the new technology?
If you want to buy a great phone in this price the please check vivo Z1 pro at least ones,it saves you aprox 2000/-."
266,The manufacturer commented on the review below,RAAJA36,"1) CAMERA QUALITY OF 5 MEGA PIXEL. CURVED IMAGES. PHOTOS DOES NOT RESEMBLE ORIGINAL.

2) BATTERY DOESN'T LAST EVEN WORKING HOURS (10 AM TO 7 PM)

3) HEARING SPEAKER CLARITY NOT GOOD. SOUNDS CHEAPER.

4) HEATING PROBLEM. YOU CAN'T KEEP NEAR EAR MORE THAN 3 MINUTES.

5) WORST PRODUCT IN THIS VALUE RANGE."
267,27 June 2019,darkness__,"The phone is good. Battery is fine. Processing is lag free. The only shortcoming is the software used in the front camera, the colour gets all flushed, but again it's a software issue, so it will be fixed in one or two software updates. Except for that the phone is worth purchasing if you want to show off the Puch hole design, and slow motion. It offers a very immersive viewing experience. Again, you can't play pubg in the full screen, and many apps are not optimized for the display, but with time and software updates, it should get better. Front camera is below decent thou. The makeup that is not necessary is added, buy why??"
268,8 July 2019,Prem Prakash,"Just talked to Prashant (Customer support ) for replcement at 10 :59 PM (08/07/19) and he wass treating me like an ediot. I said clearly that voice quality is very poor and the screen vibrates during call. However, this guy keeps insisting that it's not a faulty product. Don't buy anything from amazon. Speciall electronics Items.

Sopecial request, go with another phones instead of Galaxy M40 and never ever try to buy anything from amazon. They will send you faulty products and insist you to keep the same one."
269,5 July 2019,Pawan Jaiswal,"Never buy online mobile phone from amazon.I buy this product and the piece was faulty.After 12 days its started hang,headset is not detected,screen lock problems occur,when i asked to replace amazon did not replace my product.They told that its not in our policy to replace phone after 10 day but it was inbuilt default from the manufacture side as i asked from samsung care they told it is manufacturing problem in mother borad .So never trust on amazon to buy mobile product because they are not supporting there Customer."
270,14 October 2019,avni,"the phone did not provide the least expected job of a phone i.e the calls.
the call quality is very bad, as it has the new technology with screen sound output or some worst technology, the calls frequently gets disconnected , and sounds like as if the other person is on speaker, and our voice is also not properly audible for them
Battery life is not that good, even though i am not a gamer, still not happy with the batter life.
rest finger print sensor as it is at the back not much of use, and hence always using the front screen lock to use it,so its waste
touch sensitivity is good, and is fast
camera is ok, not that great
am a brand lover of Samsung, as all the electronics and all my previous phones are samsung, but this one disappointed a lot, i even requested for returning the product, but they did not turn up and now the status says that the return date is closed.
the delivery was quick and prompt which is the best part."
271,8 August 2019,Sankar,"The voice clarity is not being reproduced well and even in slightly noisy environment its difficult to converse without asking the person on other side to repeat a few times. Company should resolve the in call voice problem immediately otherwise, mobile business of Samsung company will be down."
272,29 June 2019,RAJEEV,It is good phone at this price. Overall look is very good. Snapdragon 675 performance is very good. Display quality is very good. Headphone is superb. Only the problem is the battery backup but it can manage with fast charging system. Display sound technology is also good. After I ordered I watched many online negative reviews but after I got phone found it is good at this price.
273,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer," mid night colour is good
screen is beautiful and large
game playing is ausum , without hanging,
battery is fine, camera is also good in this price.
and please do not compare this phone with samsung galaxy s8 ,s9, s10 and plus version becoz u cannot get that quality in 20 thousand. 😂"
274,The manufacturer commented on the review below,MD,"The audio quality on the phone is very poor.
On speaker mode you can barely hear the other person on the phone.

Also the camera quality is average. Not my best phone so far."
275,22 August 2019,Akanksha J.,"You would be amazed with the quick response that this phone gives while unlocking with finger print or face detection; however this also creates problem when you pick your phone to keep in your bag or pocket and it unlocks everytime. It doesn't have a notification flash light which annoys me a lot of time since I have started missing my pop ups as the phone lies dead whenever I see it. It has in screen sound feature which means that the sound you hear during a call comes from the screen and no dedicated listening space has been allocated. On the contrary, the phone is quite light weight unlike other monstrous and heavy ones in market these days. Moreover the processing speed is quite impressive."
276,23 June 2019,Deepak kumar,"This is my experience so far...
Camera and battery are decent.
Display is excellent.
Fingerprint is excellent but face unlock is worst.
No amoled display,No Jack,No case(disappoint)
Touch is smooth
Storage is sufficient
Unsatisfied at this price segment
It needs huge improvement in all aspects."
277,27 June 2019,ARINDAM SARKAR,"A NICE SLEEK FONE, DISPLAY, TOUCH SCREEN, OVERALL STORAGE ARE ALL GOOD. AFTER USING FOR 3-4 DAYS I FOUND ITS BIGGEST DRAWBACK TO BE ITS BATTERY WHICH IS ONLY 3500 MAH. IF YOU STAY ONLINE FOR ENTIRE DAY , YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH 10-15% BATTERY OR EVEN LESS. MYSELF, BEING A MI FONE USER WANTED TO SHIFT TO ANOTHER BRAND ,THIS TIME SAMSUNG AS I WAS IMPRESSED WITH M40 FEATURES. LOT OF FEATURES WHICH ONE WILL NOT FIND HERE IS IR BLASTER , NO SCREENSHOT TAKING FEATURE , NO BOKEH MODE FEATURE IN CAMERA. OUT OF 6GB RAM THAT IT OFFERS , USABLE RAM IS 3 GB ,WHICH IS SORT OF OK. WITH 128GB ROM & HYBRID SIM SLOT, ONE SHOULDNT THINK OF EXTERNAL MEMORY SLOT BUT IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OPTION OF , IT WOULD HAVE HELPED SOMETIME LATER. FULL SCREEN OF 6.3 INCH IS FINE , WEIGHT OF THE FONE IS OK. INCOMING RINGTONE SOUND IS QUITE LESS AS THERE IS ONLY 1 SPEAKER, THUS IF THAT SPEAKER HAPPENS TO BE BLOCKED, EVERY CHANCE OF YOU MISSING A CALL. THERE IS NO 3.5MM JACK, IT HAS A C-TYPE SLOT FOR BOTH CHARGER & HANDSFREE MICROFONE. I WONT SAY ITS A BAD FONE, BUT WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS , IT COULD HAVE BEEN FAIRLY PRICED BETWEEN 15K-17 K AS WELL."
278,21 June 2019,Amazon Customer,Poor 📷 quality
279,21 June 2019,DG,It is amazing. I just loved the looks and features. At this price point nothing can beat this phone. Though battery life is comparatively less but still it lasts whole day with all apps active.
280,1 August 2019,Gaurav,"Seriously first time I'm really devastated with the services of amazon, I've been trying to return this product but they are not taking my matter serious. This phone has lots of Bad battery. Lacks performance, heating issues, no headphone jack, earpiece is under display so the volume is really low n vibrates all the screen when u r on call & camera quality is just poor it's not a 20k phone from any sense. I'm really feeling bad after buying this thing. Amazon please n return it to the seller"
281,5 July 2019,Saurabh Sah,"Purchased this phone from Amazon using ICICI card and it was showing 950 discount to be provided by vendor , however nothing has been credited till now. Lookwise phone is slim and holding it feels good.Battery has not drained within 24 hours of normal activity till now. The camera quality is just Ok not so great pictures,however the option of 3 lens give better width in photo. The audio quality is good and the processing is above normal but not great as expected. The face sensor is working fine almost 99% times.
While I was traveling the phone got deregistered each time the network changed and this is the biggest problem with all Samsung devices. You need to manually select the operator for re-registration.
Now today it has gone to voice command mode on its own and not coming out of it. Tried restarting but it is still in that condition. Want to return but the validity is over.
Samsung publicity is more and quality less. Do not go for it."

283,16 July 2019,Kindle Customer,Poor battery doesn't even last for 14 to 16 hours.. mobile heats up for 2 hours on hotspot...even charge is not super fast takes more than 100 mins for full charge...I wanted to return but stuck with that as the charm of infinity display wore off after a couple weeks ..finger print is okay but only has 3...I think lots of basic features are missing in launcher..also I haven't got the screen protector which should be coming by default...
284,28 June 2019,Tanay Patel,"I liked this device most because it is a value for money.
It is packed with all latest features, like Punched hole display for Front camera, has wide angle camera on rear which very useful while taking the photos with less distance, USB type-C, 4G sim with VoLTE support, and most delight full is that it is powered with 3500mAh all day long battery (such a powerhouse),

OMG, it has Snapdragon 675, and 6 GB RAM & 128 GB ROM sooooo much space and performs well."
285,20 July 2019,Amar Bisht,"I am really very disappointed with this device.
I was using redmi since 2014 and thought of changing the brand in a hope that Samsung might have made some improvements in their devices. As i switched from Samsung in 2014 to redmi/mi just because of these horrible devices that they make.
But, seriously and honestly saying Samsung has not improved but has downgraded thier quality. Its just the spec's on paper, and that to just for the sake of virtual paper to paper comparison.
I don't know why the hell people on YouTube shows fake photographs that aren't captured from this device.
Do you expect these poor shots from this so called 20k phone with so called 32MP camera sensor. Even the photos from the Samsung galaxy S duos (which i had in 2013) has better picture quality with 5MP camera.
Seriously they are just faking with the written specs but the reality is something which u will get to know after wasting 20K over this.
I am only commenting regarding the picture quality.
I think the screen quality is again not so good...the pictures which were great on my old device (redmi note 5 pro) seems to be low quality on this device.
I am feeling like i have degraded my device....seriously really disappointing.
I don't knw what to say... just don't buy this device.... that too only by looking at the specs.
Live focus is just for the sake of name..i don't even find any difference in that mode and normal vedio shooting mode.
I never reviewed any device on any of the shopping website. But this device has forced me to do so..."
286,17 August 2019,Arjun Singh,"I ordered the midnight blue variant and it was delivered within two days.

Build quality: looks premium and eye catchy. With punch hole camera, it has futuristic design and definitely looks a flagship phone.

Display: I don't know why people are so high on amoled display but this one's display is quite good.

Performace: With sd675 and 6gb RAM never felt any lag with day to day tasks and light gaming. Also experience with 1UI is awesome.

Camera: Camera does it's job pretty well. Above average for the specs.

Audio: Sound is loud enough and crisp. USB Type C earphones are provided in the box and they are actually good. Also there is dolby atmos support which can be used to enhance the listening experience.

Screen Sound Technology: As there is no earpiece on this phone, the sound is produced by screen vibration during calls. Place your ear anywhere on the phone and you will be able to hear clearly. Indoors there was no problem, but in a little crowded areas the volume is little low.

Fingerprint sensor: It is snappy and accurate. It is very easy to add the fingerprint.

Battery life: Battery life is okayish, but would have been better if there was 4000 mah or more. With youtube videos, some music and some other usage, it drains quickly. But standby time is great. There also are two power saving modes which can extend battery life by limiting backgroud apps which I think is a good feature. And also with 15W quick charger, it is up and ready again in no time. Quick charging can be enabled or disabled from the settings.

Conclusion: At 20,000 rs. this is definitely a steal according to me. I wish samsung comes with more phones in M series like this with improved battery life. Go ahead and get a m40 for yourself and you won't regret."
287,29 June 2019,Devaraj R,"Amazing product from Samsung in this mid budget range, camera and its features are outstanding. Display is fabulous. Processor and its performance are outstanding, you have n no of apps in background and playing games or watching videos, you won't feel any lag at all. Only thing that could have made better is the battery which could been a 4000mah one like other models, but still one week from buy, being a continuous user of net, social media apps, games, videos, etc.. nearly 24hr battery life is given and no issue of heating up. Also about fast charging, it hardly take 1.5-2hr for full charge. All together it's an awesome phone to buy."
288,22 September 2019,Santosh,"Such a pathetic phone, within 2 months of buying my phone is not working and it gets switched off, very frequently, Samsung doesn't give good customer service"
289,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,It gets heated easily. You can not talk for a long time. You can not hear other persons voice clearly. Hearing other persons voice is a challenge and when we are out then you can bearly hear voice. Battery drains in 5 to 6 hours. Please dont buy this phone. Buy any other phone but not this for sure.
290,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ajay kumar,"camera quality very very poor, calling not clear total lost money samsung Galaxy m40 very bed"
291,21 June 2019,SRK,Fantastic camera superb display. Infinity o display is the best. Wide angle camera with triple set up captures best pics. USB type C port with fast charging also fine. Best value for money
292,29 September 2019,Ahamed Yashif A,"The worst quality phone I have ever purchased! I bought this as a gift and the screen was broken inside the package - amazon’s good service had it replaced. Lest I knew I am to prepare for the wrath of Samsung Stupidity.

1. The battery performance is on foot! Sometimes the battery gets drained from 100% to 40% only by a 5 minutes phone call. There is not third party app installed, if that’s ever been the case.

2. Listening to music using headset? Prepare to reconnect the headset during every song change. I know not of this kind of sorcery!

3. Call quality. I speak, they speak, but none hears half of the things. It is not the network issue, I tested with my previous phone.

4. Phone heats up while charging. I can understand if normal heating up, if at all that’s normal. But it is not a holdable heat, and with Samsung’s infamous battery blasts!

It’s not been even a month, and the month has become odd for my, all thanks to Samsung and the decision I made to buy this phone!

@Amazon/@Samsung : Any solutions are welcome."
293,The manufacturer commented on the review below,vijay,"1. Screen sound technology is not appreciable. Gives worst call quality, less sound & vibrates more. Technology shall be verified before releasing into the market.
2. Black shades found in bottom of display in all M40 phones.
Above problems are not expected from a company like Samsung."
294,30 September 2019,Yadhiraj,"First of all have a doubt if this product is genuine and definitely not worth 20k. The problems are multiple, triple camera of 32mp is a joke. U simply cannot take a clear picture once the sun goes down all pictures after sunset especially in dim light are blurred. My previous J7 could shoot way more superior quality pics. So the camera is basically useless. The speakers can't play full volume coz then it starts cracking and popping (which btw Samsung acknowledges as a feature: shockingly true words of online service personnel). So the dolby atmos feature is something one can't really enjoy. The ring tones are a pain to the ears and breaks my heart. The auto rotate feature unlike the sound works at its own whim. The battery charge indicator does not show percentage next to it so basically u have to guess or lock the screen. No display on locked mode and hence no clock or notification displayed. I started using my phone 1 week after delivery and hence was late in finding out the problems and thereby missed the return window by 12hrs. Do jot go by the positive reviews given the product is no better than a imitation chinese version which probably comes for 1/3rd the price. The product came 2days later than the delivery estimate shown during purchase which ofcoz after payment was shown a date 2days later which by now has become an amazon thing. After experiencing similar with a lego purchase i havd decided not to buy expensive items on amazon as the customer care washes tgeir hands off by saying its seller's problem. Strongly recommended to stay clear of this product n stpl."
295,15 August 2019,Jigar Sawla,"Quality of display is superb, picture quality is good...camera is excellent..overall the phone is very good and am happy to after buying this phone..features and look of phone is stylish. It is very light weight and handy...also it gives you the proud feel..while using the m40 phone..I suggest samsung to give battery life of 5000 mah instead of 3000mah"
296,21 June 2019,Krishnan Unni,"Very good combination of hardware and software....ticks all the boxes - camera, memory, storage, UI, security. Good package overall."
297,The manufacturer commented on the review below,PANKAJ CHIMURKAR,The camera quality of this phone is third class.. the photo size is in kb from 32 mega pixel camera which will be very low quality.. there is no option to change the camera resolution
298,2 July 2019,Prabakaran,"Decent phone with decent specs and performance.
THE GOOD: Display, compact overall size and weight, Snapdragon processors aided gaming performance and HD videos on Netflix by Widevine and Dolby sound tech are good points of this phone.
Battery will last you 8 hours on average use(4g net on all the time)
Cameras are average and deliver good quality videos rather than photos.
On-screen sound tech is not good and have poor sound quality with lot of vibrations on screen."
299,2 July 2019,Rahul Balakrishnan,"Best phone under 20k
Pros :
Infinity ""O"" display gives a premium feel
Slim & light weight
""Camera quality"" : Rear camera ia simply superb espevially the ultra wide lens
Buttersmooth UI
Fast charging is superb
Rear |fingerprint reader"" works well
Perfomance of Snapdragon 675 processor is really good as expected
No heating issues
Very less SAR value

Cons :
""Battery life"" : Battery should have been improved a bit but its ok for a 1 day moderate user(fast charging can compensate)
""Audio jack"" : 3.5 audio jack is missing and can't use old earphones(type-C earphone inside the box is of good quality)
Low light image of front cam is a little bit noisy

In total this is a superb gadget under 20k and much better than its competator redmi note 7 pro.It will beat the note 7 pro in all aspects except battery backup.
So if u are a moderate user who give importance to the perfomance of the phone and a super cool UI just go for this one."
300,27 October 2019,Agnivesh Singh,"After using the phone for 3 months thoroughly, following are my observations.
-Cameras- Average, unable to produce good quality photos. Same applies for the front camera. If you like to take photos anywhere anytime and concerned about quality, a big NO.
-Battery- Poor, a good use would surely takes the juice out of the phone.
If you are a frequent app switcher keeping the display on and/or a gamer, again a NO.
-Display- Sharp, but not crisp. An OK for viewing videos or movies.
-Fingerprint reader- Just fine, not flash quick but not slow either. Once the phone is loaded you'll see fingerprint reader showing slower response.
-Performance- Average. After thorough usage, I find it's way behind the other phones coming at this price. Lags once loaded.
Verdict- For young guys out there, who loves to take the max out of their devices this one ain't for you.
A good gift for elderlies, with a brand tag of SAMSUNG."
301,28 July 2019,prakhar,"1. Camera: The phone's stock camera overexposes pictures. Using Google camera can resolve that issue. Front camera is not bad either.
2. Battery: Fast charging but not the best. Good enough. I couldn't get through a day with full battery while using 4G & Bluetooth but it's still well optimised.
3. RAM & processor management: Hasn't faced any lags till 1 week of usage.
4. Screen: It has TFT display which is also good.
5. Speaker: Slightly less when compared to others but it's loud and clear.
6. Fingerprint: Sometimes not fully responsive, maybe because of the silicon case.

They haven't provided a case in the box. The earphones are in-ear types which have bad bass."
302,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Siddhant Bose,"Well there is very little to like about this phone so I'll come directly to the worse features.
Lots of phone heating.
Bad UI, unnecessary complex options where u hate it the most.
Don't buy this phone if you talk for more than one hour a day as the voice reception is of poor quality ( in call voice)
Pathetic speakers, battery life is also weak.
There is nothing that I would recommend for this phone even network is an issue on this one."
303,13 July 2019,Raja,"Drawbacks,
I led Display is ok compared with infinity display.
India sim lock must use India sim for some time but sure about unlock.
Battery drains fast on continuous usage.

Advantages
One of the best software’s I have seen I android but nothing compared with apple though in terms of security.
Camera
Ram and storage"
304,14 September 2019,Amazon Customer,"I bought this phone on june 24. And now its speaker has stopped working, it is not supporting the earphones which were inside the box, battery life sucks. You cannot play pubg in it. It works very slow even if you change the game settings to medium. And all this happened within 2 months. This is not a product in which anyone should invest his 20,000. I am writing this when i got literally irritated from this device."
305,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Mufi,"Camera quality is very bad. The actual colour is not getting. Selfi camera also is not good..
Totally i am not satisfied. No battery back. Very poor.
Please Note: There is no return policy for this. Only replacement if there is technical issue or different."
306,31 July 2019,Sandeep,"Being samsung fan

On 19 June I purchased m-40 from Amazon but the phone is not as per my expectations the voice quality is very poor. There is no voice clarity though which is the main feature the phone was talked

not expected from Samsung 20K product

I am completely disappointed from samsung

Most dissatisfied feature is voice clarity."
307,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Gaurav P@LL¤D,"Worst things :-
1.Incoming Sound quality poorest (I want return due to very poor quality )
2.Headphones are useless even very poor quality bass
3.so many features not available like Bixby....
4.Screen start flickring if any c type wire is connected to mobile
5.screen guard not provided
5.while charging get heated slightly

Good things:-
1.Fingerprint reader
2.screen display
3.camera features like hyperlapse, super slow motion

Not more than this...."
308,11 September 2019,Amazon Customer,"Touch sensitivity should be improved as its not responding properly sometimes or not at all and we had to turn off the display and turn on to make it work.
Contacts information should be improved. Currently it doesn't show complete contact profile from the recent calls info bar. Rather we had to go to contacts and open the info to get complete information about the contact profile.
Sometimes I face problems with SiM card manager. It shows as if sim card is not inserted or slot empty but when I turn off and on the sim from settings it will be detected and runs normal. Please fix it.
Sometimes the screen doesn't get locked. I even turned off smart lock. But still the screen doesn't get locked and when I swipe the home screen will be displayed without pin or finger print. Security is compromised.

Everything else is great to experience."
309,30 June 2019,MANISH VERMA,"I am a samsung user had j7 used it for 2 years and now this phone which is better than other Samsung phones , just need to improve the focus of camera as it is not able to focus the nearby objects fast...
Thank you so much samsung for delivery such good products and services..
Happy customer✌🏼"
310,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Raam,Utter disappointment. Waste of money
311,12 August 2019,afzal,"I have to charge the battery 2 times a day for normal ( no gaming or movies, just surfing, browsing internet as i frequently checks the stock market ) use that also in optimised mode. I have decreased the brightness, and put in night time mode.
All photos taken is blurry because there is no image stabilizer. Even though good camera hardware image quality is poor...
The screen sound technology is a disaster. Its similar to using speaker mode in normal phones. You wont get any privacy. If u are in a silent room like in conferences everyone could hear what the other person is speaking.

Although the processor is awsome samsung should have provided with a suitable platform to support it....
Not worth at this price.."
312,29 June 2019,Kaustubh,The Samsung M40 is an amazing phone. Infact I was a bit surprised that Samsung could offer such a brilliant device at such a low price. The 6 GB Ram and the Snapdragon Processor is perfect for all my games which includes PUBG. Plus the Graphic Card provides you with mindblowing picture quality. The camera is super awesome and clear. I absolutely fell in love with the Infinity O display. It does not hinder your gaming at all. Infact it looks pretty cool. The speakers of the phone are also pretty loud and clear. The fast charging is definitely a boon as it allows you to always be on the go. 3500 mah is not less as many people think. I think this is the perfect budget phone for a teenager like me.
313,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Sanjay s.,"Camera quality isn't good,both camera's front and rear are not ok,I love and like samsung mobiles but M40 mobile camera have something wrong.all picture comes as pale and representative of amazon said it's beauty .what the hell beauty
We need original picture
I am not convinced with amazon replacement policy and their application to check camera quality
According to them customer wrong about camera and their application right...wooowwww"
314,27 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Hi I bought this Samsung Galaxy M40 overall this phone is good but there are few things I would like the Samsung to improve it and those are,

1- ""Face unlock""
While unlocking the phone through face recognition after you show your face it should open and the home screen should appear but in this case it's getting unlocked but again you have to swipe the lock screen then only the home screen appears.

2- ""Phone startup speed""
Once you restart your phone when the phone is switched ON it take few seconds to start mentioning that your phone is starting. When as it should be little more fast ..

3- ""Camera quality""
The front camera of the phone is not as clear as it should be compared to 16MP because it looks like there is a inbuilt filter added to the camera and mostly the pictures clicked are coming whitish.

4- ""Battery Life""
As u see the battery is 3500 mAH it's draining out a bit fast n doesn't even last up to 24hrs when ur mobile data is on and I am a very moderate user hardly 10 calls a days and a bit of social media exploring."
315,20 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Let me start with probs that this phone but will like to share after 72 hours of phone used
Pros
Design is good.
It is not heavy nor to light.
Samsung one GUI is good.Since I don't like Chinese phone gui.
No lag in phone.
No heating problem with normal daily uses.
Camera is decent.
Con
Battery life is not that good.If your phone is more on mobile 4g network then battery will drain very fast.
Face recognition still take time even after Samsung has released a update for the same.
Fingerpint also take noticeable time as compared to its competitors in same price range.
I switched on Airplane mode.After switching back off my phone network didn't came.
Need to restart it.
Apps are not using full screen even I have enabled the settings to use the full screen."
316,22 June 2019,Rajat Dwivedi,"I watched countless reviews before purchasing, and every one said that the battery backup is decent. It was decent too when I was using it out of the box, but after installing the day one update, the battery performance has become horrible. The rest is fine and dandy, but the battery performance disappoints.

Edit: So after some days of use, it feels like the device is a scam. The 170k+ antutu scores that YouTubers were recieving were a sham, or maybe these ""reviewers"" were given some special units which were beating Redmi Note 7 Pro in antutu. This phone is supposed to have Snapdragon 675, and this is the performance I get? My Moto G5S plus performs better than this phone. Look at the attached camera sample, feels like taken from a cheap Chinese phone. Just too many cons in this device to list, only one pro is the Hole punch. Don't even think of gaming on this phone, PUBG and even light games like Asphalt Nitro are unplayable due to horrible lag. Better go with Note 7 Pro or Realme 3 pro. Thinking of getting a refund."
317,The manufacturer commented on the review below,sana ismail,Software is not getting update. Google Play not working. Samsung has made fool in June.
318,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Ordered during first sale and first time user of Samsung mobile phone,fell into the trap of hype created around m40 and totally dissatisfied with the product.facing lot of heating issue right from day 1 ..literally cannot touch the screen or take the call getting near to my ear..the basic functionality of phone is of no use then why should I buy this phone.the call quality is very bad had to repeat twice,battery back up is very bad.all in all a very bad experience and regretting.absolutely not getting any support from Amazon"
319,20 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Pros:
Speed
Touch response
Wide angle lens (rear) is superb if you really looking for landscape shots.
Sound from the screen is good (though you feel it vibrates)
Lowest SAR value (.2)
Feels good in the hand (less weight) and premium looks.
Patches and updates
Samsung's support.

Cons:
Face recognition is just ok.
Camera quality is also ok.
Battery lasts barely for a day. (Mixed usage)"
320,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Yogendra Reddy,"Camera failed and hardware defects in side.

Built quantity is good.
Play pubg is extremely good.
After bugs fixed screen color awesome.
Camera is added with fuzzy blur in images and videos.
Speaker is horrible for traveling people must use earphones talking or watching videos.
Camera hardware is sleeping."
321,3 August 2019,Muppana Prasad,"To be told in one word... Beast 🔥🔥
Everything is awesome with the phone. Earlier , I have read few of reviews and worried about the lack of 3.5mm jack. But , nothing to worry guys... The earphones provided are best . Of course , everyone switched to Bluetooth now a days...
Camera.. is good in day light.. you can capture the best if you are taking pics in the right way. Front camera also runs well..
Believe me , played pubg and asphalt 9... Not even a single lag guys .. not even a single one.. phone's temperature was also normal..
Then.. The Snapdragon processor is running in the smoothest way.. multitasking is excellent.
The back side, sea water blue is COOL. Simply COOL. Gives an awesome and descent look.
Since it comes with a Gorilla glass,nothing to worry. But better put a tempered glass. Phone's a bit slippery, I suggest a solid silicon case to protect it...
Honestly I really loved the product and thanks to Samsung and Amazon."
322,21 June 2019,Siddharth rawat,"It's just awesome guys.
Camera -4/5😋
Display-5/5😉
Performance-5/5🤪
Battery-3.5/5🥺🥺🥺🥺
I AM LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BY ITS BATTERY LIFE🥺"
323,The manufacturer commented on the review below,nikhil sagar,"Please don't but this product if you use basic calling functionality, whatsapp and listen to music.
1. The voice through the speaker is very unclear. It very distorted and robotic.
2. Whatsapp gets stuck when we video call using ear phones. I can't change the camera to front an back view while on call, cannot mute, cannot pause camera and cannot use text while on call.
3. The ear phones facility in general is horrible. When you listen to music through youtube and them swap to a local music player, then the song playes but you cannot hear anything.
4. The touch is not always sensitive. You may need to click on the icon 4-5 times sometimes.
5. I have once muted the phone because I was in a hospital but when I unmuted and increased all volues to 100%, the phone was still vibrating during calls while showing the volume as 100%!
6. Front camera captures different shared and back camera captures different shades."
324,27 June 2019,Mohit Kharbanda,"I would like to start with the phones look,which is impeccable though its plastic body but it doesn't even look like one moreover everyone's phone wears a security phones cover so it hardly matters its plastic or metal secondly if I talk about the camera it's amazing,triple back camera with amazing front camera makes it more suitable for selfie lovers. 6GB ram with 128GB internal memory doesn't make ya phone lag anywhere. Only one drawback is u can either use second sim or the memory card, it doesn't support the on screen finger print sensor but it has a finger print sensor at the back but it has face recognition on the contrary but phones look nullify it all. It has everything what you can expect in 20k phonebattery life is like you need to charge once in morning the battery lasts for good 10- hours full use, In short I will give 9 out of 10 for every feature I would recommend a must buy if you want to buy a phone in this budget"
325,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Shankar das,I am said that don't buy this phone but if you looking a great and next level phone then you have to buy if. I am very disappointed to Amazon they stated offers as they like so i bought this phone july 16 last day of the deal and i have also replace my old MI phone so they when got the New M40 that was totally damaged phone not working properly and even don't charge phone and lots of issue the phone seems like hot when charge phone so finally i called the support and told all happens but he said we have no stock the same Phone and we are not able to change so you think you bought 20000 Rs phone and its not working properly how you fell so finally i mail to higher team then after after 20 days i will got new proper working phone and Amazon support they don't have manner how help customers ...............so its my last deal with Amazon .
326,25 June 2019,Ramansh,"Pros and cons for buying m40
Pros- comparing it with its other competitors in this range say real me 3 pro , redmi note 7 pro, or even samsung a50 this phone has go the best look , it is the lightest amongs the all, it is the slimmest amongst all, feel good in the hand and even give a premium feel compare to others...other phones literally feel like a brick in your hand..
Compare to real me and red mi....
-it has one ui better then the operating systems use in above two
-It has gestures involved giving a premium feel when we use it
-color the seawater blue color is at par the best u vould see onany phone...
-the infinty o display again gives a mini s10 feel
-although being a lcd the colors of samsung are much more vibrant and real then the others.
- brightness if the phone is much more then the others
- includes Dolby atmos improving its sound

Compapring with a50
- storage is more 128gb a50 does not provide storage above 64gb
- processor is better being snapdragon675
- overall looks the points i included above are applicable here also...

Cons-
- Battery life is small but the 15w fast charged is amazing...charges the phone fron 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20 min..
- camera quality..u can look upon some YouTube videos ti compare every phone camera has its pros and cons...overall canera is average....but for a normal in routine photography its serves the purpose well and good...
-i read people writing voice geard is low its not like that...just clarifying the point the sound of the incoming call comes from the in display speaker but still u got to place your ear on the top to get the best quality however its good where ever u put it..

Overall i would definetly recommend this phone to or the following reasons-
-premium look
-premium feel when u use it
-best in class color
-infinity o display feels unique
-gaming experience was awesome no lag experienced while playing pubg or asphalt 9
- no heating issues
-fast charging"
327,25 June 2019,Akshay,"The phone is fast, the face unlock and the touch have decent feedback, probably could tweek the touch response time but nothing to worry much about, the display is amazing and colorful and the phone though has a big screen is kind of sleek to hold on too, also supports one handed user interface, so thats a plus
Battery is fine for me, it lasts a day and a half, I'm not into hardcore gaming, even if i do play, probably and hour or so of pubg mobile or fortnite mobile, although I'm connected youtube and social media all the time the battery has been really decent, the camera quality is supreme, natural light photographs are the best, i really like the wide angle camera, also i don't really need to click low light photographs so low light photography performance dosen't matter.
The no headphone jack is fine for me too, since I'm mostly connected via bluetooth headsets, rarely used wired ones in my old handset too, so dont miss it as such, however samsung has done nice to provide Type C headphones in the box. I would have loved if they would have provided a transparent case with the handset too."
328,30 June 2019,Jeevan Bhushetty,"Camera:
1. Rear: Good quality rear camera, performs well in low light areas. The best thing is the wide angle camera which covers a good amount of the area but sometimes I see few objects get stretched in wide angle mode.
2. Front: Good front camera but auto smoothening of the skin can be seen in front camera, Good thing we have wide angle option for front camera which will give you good group selfies.

Performance: it comes with 6GB ram out of which 3GB ram can be used, performance has been really very smooth you won't see any lags or delays in opening apps. You can use for high-end gaming without much hitting issue.

PubG: Good mobile for PubG lovers, no lags, no hitting issues. Samsung gives you inbuild game launcher app which allows you to record gaming video, take screenshots, manage notifications, etc. so now can manage your notifications and phone calling while playing PubG.

Design: This is one of the best things you will get with a mobile, excellent front camera in display gives it a different look. Mobile is very lightweight and slim in design. The back panel also well designed and give you good grip and excellent look.

Battery: This has been an area of problem for this mobile since it comes with 3500mAH lithium-ion battery it drains fast. 4000mAH should have done great justice to this mobile, but anyways this supports fast charging so does that solves a problem for me.

Screen: Great touch gives you a good experience when using it, On-screen sound is really cool but sometimes you might feel some problem in listing on phone calls, bit difficult to you in mobile in sunlight even in high brightness mode but overall I like the display and punch hole front camera is really well managed you will never fell it comes in between of your apps."
329,27 June 2019,Sandeep malik,"Display 5/5
Great infinity o display with vibrant quality colors
Speaker 4/5
Main speaker have very good sound
Plus the Dolby atoms make earphones experience amazing
But on screen speaker doesn't sound very clear
Spec 5/5
Smooth running from last5,6 few days
Used in a very light manner
No hanging till now
Camera 4/5
Again not so great camera by Samsung but quality is good if it is not great
As by front camera it gives extra blurr and light in background
And the main pair of camera is little upward from the back of phone
The lens cover may damage soon by scratch
But you can use a good cover to handle it
Design 5/5
You will love it handling in your hand
So slim and light weight
No bezel and infinity display makes the look amazing and stylish
personally I don't like the midnight blue colour but still is shines and give premium look
Battery 4.5/5
The only thing has make me disappoint is the charging speed
The 15 watt charger is not so fast as it gives 70% in 1 hour
But the 3500mah battery runs all day long smoothly
And it only consumes 60 to 70 % in whole day
Sensor 4.5/5
Here I miss the touch on screen reply
You need to use fingerprint which is very very fast
Or press the lock button to ai face recognition that is very smart and fast.
User interface 3.5/5
I thought it would be good to use new ui but it is new or what
I am little uncomfortable with this ui
Hope so I will be compatible with it in near future
Overall I m falling in love with this smart device ...
It's a good choice in this range that I have made"
330,The manufacturer commented on the review below,swarnim,"You won't be getting any special software which comes in J7 or such, like secure folder, etc, and also you won't be able to install them as Samsung has not provided the required hardware for it. So you will have to depend on third party apps for it. Samsung used its WORST hardware in this phone. Camera is below the quality of Redmi 4 which comes in 8K. So paying 20K for just 6 & 128 GB combo. Rest everything is below average."
331,22 June 2019,VB,"Phone, Configurations were good, but they could have provided Amoled-display instead of IPS LCD, this feature is a major drawback, we can feel it when we use and Battery 3500mah is bit low , heavy usage or game play drains Battery fast.

Apart from that all were fine"
332,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Dear Buyers,

In one line i want to say that its a waste of money to buy this mobile handset.

I am using this handset since 12 days, and i am writing this review after full inspection of this handset.

This handset doesn't have the quality equivalent to its value.

Camera- Camera is a worsest part, they are using quad pixel technology with the main camera setup (which is 32 mp in paper) actually this camera is just 8 MP in real but due to quad pixel technology they are claiming that the camera is 32 MP, Its camera quality is worst ever i am not seeing any mobile even under 14k budget of this kind of camera.
no detailing in pictures lots of noise in pics if you want to zoom the photo, please dont try it will gives you a blurry pic like a vga camera.
I think this camera sensor is not even of 8MP.

Battery - Battery backup is very low, mobile starts heating after some time of use in outdoor. Battery is not going more than 8 hrs.

Mobile Body - Only after 10 days of use the color of mobile body starts fading (could you believe something like this from a brand like samsung).

Software - Some times it starts lagging if you are opening many apps at once.

The conclusion of this review is please dont buy this phone, you can buy motorola one vision in same range but better in quality."
333,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ajaykrishnan,"Got a defective product. Front camera wasn't working properly. It was capturing shakey any blurly images. After long struggle and talking n no. of calls with customer care, I had return initiated for this product. I wsnt expecting such a poor product and irresponsible, uncustomer friendly approach from amazon"
334,30 June 2019,manojkumar,"Built of M40 is good with slim and lite weight.The innovation of punch hole cam and screen sound technology in this budget phone were awesome,but the front camera quality is average and rear cameras are good with wideangle,livefocus,promode,slomo and superslomo videos.The headphone adapter and backcase might present within the box.M40 will not apt for heavy users due to 3500 mah battery.Both cameras are struggling in lowlight shots without dedicated night mode.The oneUI does good job with more options like onehanded mode,themes,etc.It has retained the memory quickly while using more apps usage due to 6GB RAM.presence of Dual messenger is good.
Actual charging time-150 mins ,which might be less. Fingerprint reader is quick but not the quiker one. we can't feel the place of fingerprint reader without case.widevine L1 certification and Less SAR value are the additional advantages.Audio output is good with both headphone provided within box and bottom speaker.It doesn't has that bad quality of TFT LCD panel which we found on old Samsung devices,this display has good viewing angles,vibrant,brightest among other displays.
It provides some important messages like 1.dust on your cam.lens -before taking the shot
2.your phone had more heated
Devicecare feauture helps to clean junk and cache files.And it acts like a doctor of device."
335,9 October 2019,Debasis D.,"Never though the decision to chose Samsung over OnePlus/Xiaomi would have such alarming consequences for me in the first month itself.

1. Sound quality while receiving calls is a disaster.
The vibrating-screen sound technology has neither been tested nor been tuned to actual user-scenario.
2. Stock ear-phone provided with the phone is another disaster.
While watching video streaming/playback, if there is any notification, the earphone stops working.
The only way to make it work is unplug & plug again.
3. The incoming call-details doesnt get displayed on the screen if the phone is locked.

Seems like this model was released with ""0 quality checks"".
Samsung needs to learn a lot and that too at a fast pace from OnePlus/Xiaomi as to how to make phones that dont give nightmares to the end-users.
More importantly, Samsung needs to unlearn its screwed-up QA process.

Yes, I might sound like a Samsung-hater here,but, my previous phone was a Redmi1S that I literally abused for 5 yrs without a single issue.

p.s:
I used Samsung CRT TV for 10 yrs and my Samsung refigerator is 8 yrs old, and have never had a single issue with either of these.
I have realized that I was an ass to expect the same quality from Samsung phones."
336,25 October 2019,Tanmay,"I Like Egronomic Design Of This Phone, which comes with bezel less and 0 notch display. The colour is the favourite part and also the serene colour options; mine is seawater one!
The camera is 32+16mp but it should be 48+16mp. The battery is where I disappointed; they must've given 4000mAh-4500mAh and then the camera quality of 32+16mp would be justified. Also it heats up after 30-45 mins of continued usage😵!!!

I would suggest all to buy A80, A70s or M30s 😊😊😊"
337,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Nikhil chanji,"Unable to answer a single call without earphones.
Battery drains very fast."
338,21 June 2019,Vishal Kudu,"All functioned are good but battery backup is just only 3500 so this is not enough for whole day.Otherwise Camera,Display,Pergormance is very very good."
339,13 July 2019,Harshal Patankar,I feels this is one of the best handset one could get that is under 20k rupees. A lot of available storage and ram and also a very good camera. The infinity display looks really good and the midnight blue colour goes really well on the phone. Only If you are into playing high graphics games like PUBG it's not the best becoz the processor could have been better than the snapdragon 600 series ....otherwise this phone is just perfect.
340,18 August 2019,karthik,"Phone looks slim and elegant very hand to operate too...camera is good not like the best but ok types,4k video recording,slow motion video recording and hyperlapse vedio recording are the best part of camera features,face recognition is not up to the mark, battery backup is not so great ofcourse it comes with 15w fast charger Samsung definitely can improve better here by giving 4000 Mah atleast and by spending 20k Customers deserve for 20w and above fast charger,typeC ear phones are good produces good quality sound output...Samoled display might be the other important feature that Samsung is not offering for this phone ,so M40 display screen is not upto the mark in this price range...the main reason I bought this phone is security purpose we can rely on Samsung better than Chinese phones and the next thing is SAR value is just 0.200kw/g which is very good thing, since I do get more calls every day so this phone helps me with better radiation than other h
20k budget phones..am not fond of video games so am not going to comment on it... speaker phone I good but it can be better...
Overall it's good but slightly over priced or else Samsung have to improve those cos like battery size,charger, display,face recognition"
341,10 September 2019,Rama Krishna,"I used to Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) for the past 3 years. The experience was very good except the average camera. It was a very good in terms of durability and productivity for intensive use for office work, social media and videos etc. Considering my previous experience with Lenovo decided not to buy China products. Hence, opted for the Samsung Galaxy M40. I am using the phone since 31st August 2019.

Smooth UI, response and excellent display are the plus points.

I use the phone for the emails, news on Daily Hunt, Social Media, and an occasional video. I must say the battery is pathetic. I have to charge the phone twice a day. Battery drains faster than my old phone despite optimization of screen brightness and put the applications into sleep. Also, the phone heats up while charging and also while using continuously

Second major drawback is the camera. Both front and back cameras produce suboptimal pictures not ever average photos. Optiming M40 is my biggest mistake based on the past performance.

Lesson learned
PAST PEFRFORMANCE DO NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE"
342,25 June 2019,Ashish,"Good sleek design, size just perfect for holding in one hand, neither too large nor to small, great screen to phone ratio, good UI easy to use & access apps, however icons could have been slightly smaller, screen sound tech is average but u need to get used to it & identify the right spot to place your eardrum but large uninterrupted screen compensates for the average screen sound tech.
Sound quality is awesome with Dolby atmos feature for earphones, with a c type earphone Jack the sound is awesome treat for ears, the camera are good but the deal breaker is wide screen camera of this phone, the videos & pics taken in wide screen mode are like very very good. Other than that for tik tik lover some gr8 effects are provided also with slow mo & super slomo effects.
Fingerprint touch sensor works perfectly fine, while face lock feature work good, only off is that after it reads your face and unlocks the phone still have to slide it to actually arrive at your home page, maybe with further updates it will get sorted. Battery life is one& a half day with average usage no gaming."
343,23 June 2019,Shubham,"If anybody already used Samsung higher end phones then I would recommend don't buy it. Processor is big but phone is too slow and lacks many times.
Second of all camera is 32 mp but quality of photos is like ordinary. Some can definitely tell that photo is not from high quality camera. Also camera is very slow to process.
The build quality is moderate. Face detection is slow.takes around 3-4 sec.to open.
The only thing I like is the screen size. Huge and impressive."
344,25 June 2019,Rahul,"Meine 1st time samsung mobile purchase kiya h. My 1St phone is Moto M but wo lost ho gaya afterthat main bhut confuse tha konsa mobile purchase karu phir redmi note 7 pro launch hua,phir Samsung galaxy a50,inke review dekhe tabhi m40 launch ho rha tha meine 15 days bas review aur compare kr rha tha afterthat m40 purchase kiya. I am very happy for 6gb ram and 128 internal diya h.

Pros:
1) Display looks good, Infinity O (punch hole display) slim piece. Midnight blue.
2)Picture Quality is good. FHD
3)Camera is best(32+8+5mp)rear & Front(16mp). 4K Video recording super slow motion. Rear Finger print is best.
4) Snapdragon 675 fast operating, 6gm ram 128 internal.
5)type c ear phone best Sound quality, Dolby Atmos. NFC
6) Battery (3500mah) back up accha h 1 days jati h. Fast charging 15 W
7) Features are very nice.

Cons: Screen sound technology, on speaker diya h call krne pe thoda vibrate hota h voice thodi clear nhi aati but Ok. Samjta h . Isme ear speaker dete toh Awesome.

Baki sab Awesome h....Thanks Samsung."
345,The manufacturer commented on the review below,ashish sharma,"I won't say the product is bad. But there are some software compatibility issues main thing for me is it doesn't support Bixby, the display has a blur edge at the bottom and at the camera circle. Want to return it but unfortunately 1st time amazon refused to return the product. Didn't expected this after having such old buying relation. They should have specified in the specs that it doesn't support Bixby which is a normal app which comes in every samsung mobile. Anyway I m disappointed."
346,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Saphila,"Received a defective item. Speaker produing an unpleasant noise. Front camera is a complete disappointment. one can get a much better camera quality from honor or other brands in the same price range. Rest everything looks good. As there is no return option available for mobile phones one has to request for a replacement. For this also Amazon takes so much of your time. Waiting for my replacement, hopefully it comes soon."
347,30 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Excellent mobile. Great slick design with highly optimized SD 675 offers great performance and about 24-30 hrs of battery life if you tweak the power management, display and notification settings right. Camera is great with screen optimizer turned off. The punch hole display is crisp and clear unlike A50 / A70 which have grainy AMOLED. The mobile is thinner than iPhone and very slippery without a cover. Just get the higar nillkin cover for this and you'll be good."
348,22 August 2019,Uzair Ansari,"Firstly I would give 2 star for Amazon Services. I bought this phone on no cost emi along with an additional order of Bluetooth. Amazon was not abke to deliver the Bluetooth so it cancelled my order from their side. Along with this they also cancelled the no cost emi on my mobile phone which is really disappointing. I ordered this phone just because I was having an option of no cost emi. But sadly they cancelled from thier end. Have contacted Amazon support thrice but it was of no help. Worst service and support by Amazon.

About the phone:
Phone is really good. It's looks, dimensions, performance is much good. Battery life is awesome. It lasts for complete day, Sometimes two days. Apart from this, the cons are very less. To be specific, I would rate earpiece 2 out of 5. As sometime it becomes really difficult to hear as voice is too low. Since the earpiece is in the display, the voice is scattered and not centered. Due to this, sound spreads around and people nearby are abke to hear."
349,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Vikas R,"Audio quality: Audio quality of this device is very bad. The reason maybe there is no visible ear piece. It seems like the person is talking to you from very far away even in the highest settings.

Build quality: Cheat plastic build, it will be evident when you pull out the sim cardholder. Its cheap plastic!

Screen quality: At first it seems fine but when I see against a white background then one can see a black shadow coming out from the bottom of the screen. That is also around the front camera.

Camera quality: Normal camera seems ok but the wide lens is not good.

Battery quality: It takes more time to charge and the battery drains rapidly while watching video

In all the cons, the audio quality is the main problem with this phone.

I called Amazon for the return but the agent said they need to verify that with a technician before a return. That's very discouraging. Nobody buys a product just to return it without a reason."
350,26 July 2019,Debasish,"The design is good and sleek and the phone feels light too.
The OneUI is quite good and smooth and also includes the dark/night mode which I really love.
The rear triple camera setup is just okay. You can get 32mp only in one mode and in that too pictures are not very clear. Although the front camera is quite good and can take pictures in portrait mode too.
The battery is just okay and would harely last a day with moderate usage. It give a screen on time of around 4 hrs.
The punch hole camera looks great and gives a premium look to the phone."
351,The manufacturer commented on the review below,ullas,The onscreen sound is very poor and not audible even with max volume. They given me a type c head phone with half broken wire. No scheme to replace it. Battery life and camera is good.
352,29 June 2019,Shubham,"In my opinion, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is one of the finest smartphone in its price range. The phone offers latest punch-hole display, a stylish design and a sufficiently powerful processor for Rs 19,990. The camera performance isn't the strongest in its price range, but fairly good overall. The phone is a delight for mobile gaming users and it offers latest software experience out-of-the-box. What it misses is a 3.5mm audio port, but Samsung ships a USB Type-C earphones in the box. But I would still call the Galaxy M40 a good mix of hardware and software from Samsung, which didn't let me miss having a flagship phone.

Pros-
1.Fast performance
2.Excellent Display
3.Good camera quality
4.Good battery backup
5.Lightweight
6.Excellent security by fingerprint and face unlock
7.Good design
8.No heating at all

Cons-
1.No 3.5 audio jack

Overall best in price..

You can go for it blindly.."
353,7 August 2019,Imamul Haq Ansari,"Major concerns the most of the buyers are talking about:

a. Camera hardware is much more capable but the real problem is with the camera app image processing.

b. It is not the battery hardware that is causing low battery life.
In One UI you have a lot of battery life extending options but on this device just to make the performance much more smooth none of them enabled by default.
So make a few adjustments and you'll easily get more than a day battery life.

Make these few adjustments and you'll get to know what a beast this device really is:

1. For Camera:
If you are not happy with the camera, install GCam and enjoy the real camera capability of the device.

2. For battery:
Enable dark mode.
Use 'adaptive power saving' in power mode.
Use 'sleeping apps' option in battery settings in device care.
Set the network to '2G only' for the second sim.
Use a black wallpaper for both lock and home screen."
354,29 June 2019,Gaurav Singh,"Reviews after 10 days.
Pros:
1. Fingerprint reader is very quick and fast responsive.
2. Camera quality of rear camera is excellent specially am loving wide angle camera performance you can take group selfies.
3.Display is also good with punch hole display you can take premium feel in this price segment like s10 plus.
4. Battery life is also good but it can be improved with 4000 mah as is it 3500 mah overall battery backup is good in normal uses it gives full day performance.
5. Audio/Video sound quality is loud as enough as it have only mono speaker at bottom.
6. Design built quality is awesome.

Cons.
1. We can get a better display in this range as Samsung A70 super amoled display.
2.Front camera can be improved with software updates as it produce more whitening skin tone but for selfie lovers it can be good no need of editing the pics after taking selfie they can directly upload on their social media."
355,The manufacturer commented on the review below,V Anand Reddy,"Worst I had purchased ever. I never experienced this much worst phone from Samsung.
Amazon services also becoming worst than worst"
356,28 August 2019,Rakesh Chander Bamrara,"This device is awesome on every prospects in this price range looks too good.

First I had reviewed this device on different tech expert site and thos device good to go

Having snapdragon processor in M series
Ram 6 GB device runs super cool
Rom 128 means you need not to add sd card
Samsung screen resolution excellent no doubt
No lack seems in this device
If you are planning good to go
New technology used for sound come behind the screen
Type c chaging and audio Jack same port
You can connect charger either way this means you don't need to see Jack position is correct or not
I believe this will help who are looking for this device"
357,24 June 2019,Deepak,I am using this phone from last 2 days. Camera and touch is good. battery performance is not up to the expectation. Bad experience is with on screen speaker. It vibrates a lot and voice quality very bad. Did not expect from Samsung
358,3 October 2019,S S V Vara Prasad,"Worst phone I have ever used. Waste of money. Don't buy.

I thought Samsung will have good performance.

But this phone not working properly. Every time asking to insert a sim even it has sim. Again and again have to restart the hand set.

After serving also same problem repeated. No use of giving service centre.

I lost my 20k with this phone. It Doesn't worth a single penny."
359,16 August 2019,krishna singh,"Brought 3 sets of M40 for my family members together. But just after 1week all the handsets started showing some weird issue. Like sometime ringing would come but call attending screen is not visible, battery drops from 100 to 20 as soon as charger is removed, while hearing some songs audio keep cutting in between.
Seriously better to stay away from Samsung now."
360,20 August 2019,MKRC,Not as good as expected. Display is average. The camera picture quality also not so good compared to other phones in this price range. Battery life is really bad. Hardly with stands for 12 hrs with power mode on. My 2 year old One plus 5 battery holds better than this brand new phone. The most annoying feature is the on screen ear phone for calls. The voice clarity is not at all good. Not worth the money in this range.
361,2 September 2019,Om Rane,"The phone does not have a 3.5mm slot for the headphone jack. If you are used to using wired earphones you will not be able to use earphones and charge the phone at the same time. The phone does ship with usb-c type earphones though, and you can always use bluetooth earphones if you are ok with using them.

The Fingerprint sensor often times doesn't work or requires me to wipe my finger as well as the sensor 1-2 times before working. As a person who prefers using a long password instead of a swipe-pattern, this can be annoying.

The battery life is only 3000 mAH , which is just enough to get you through the day provided you do not play games for extended periods of time.

Even though the screen is LCD, it is very crisp and bright. If you use your phone in the dark, the screen is relatively bright even after sliding the brightness slider all the way down to 0."
362,28 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Pros:
1. Phone display,this looks pretty good within this budget. Definently punch hole looks better than notch display.
2.Fast charger.It can charge upto 70% in approx 20/25 mins.
3. camera is good with features live focus and slow motion video.
4. Performance is also pretty good with snapdragon processor.

Cons:
1. There is no speaker in the phone.They put some new technology in which sound comes from entire screen.Lot of improvements required here. Voice quality is not at all clear.Sometimes I have to put the call on speaker to listen properly.

2. Battery backup is not good keeping in mind that its not amoled screen and doesn'thave latest snapdragon processor.

3. Sound quality as I mentioned above is not good.Videos,songs or call whatever. Headphone quality is also average.But anyway who gives free headphones now a days :)"
363,28 June 2019,Shubham,"First of all thanks to SAMSUNG for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than other brands. I checked other device in this price segement at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for M40 and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.
Pros:
1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, Samsung has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.
2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. M40 with the punch hole display with the such small bezels screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. It gives premium feel just like Samsung S10 series.
3. Camera: Looks like the image is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. Its fast and works extremely well.
4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all. If you are a heavy user it will last a day for sure.
5.Charging: Type c charger provided in box is good and does charging rapidly.
6. Performance: We have seen this Snapdragon 675 chipset in redmi note 7 pro. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance.
7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear.
8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.
9. Face lock is fast and finger print is faster as well.
10. No heating issue even if you use it for 2-3 hours of gaming nd other usage.

Cons:
1. Hybrid sim slot

Just 1 cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret."
364,29 June 2019,Hussain Mamaji,"My s8's screen broke and I needed a new phone asap as I had important calls to deal with. I found out about this phone and for some reason wanted this one only, waited for it to come on sale and purchased it then. The delivery was on time and the phone was as beautiful as I had imagined. The screen is big and the front camera doesn't take up part on the screen, it's close to not being there, so the screen just brightens up more! The fingerprint reader is slow detecting a finger while installing a fingerprint, but reading is quite fast. The facial recognition is on point, don't even need to type in my password! The camera is great, but not as great I had expected, but for 20,000 it is great! I charge my phone overnight for 100% in the morning and head over to college by and come back by 6pm with 40% remaining, so the battery life is amazing! Overall I loved the phone."
365,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Jatinder A.,"Generally, I go easy on things and tend to ignore minor shortcomings. Though this phone seems to be a big mistake. The main feature of any phone is to talk. Audio quality of the phone is too bad. You could hardly hear what other person is saying and your voice is not audible to other side. This happens 5 out of 10 times. I highly suggest not to waste your money on this phone."
366,31 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Likes
The phone firstly looks awesome with the punch hole display
Speed and storage is excellent, no lag found, pubg runs at highest settings
Although not Amoled, display is still great if you are not very specific abt it

Dislikes
The face unlock is slow and doesn't work at times
Auto brightness has some glitch and doesn't work as per ambient light
On call voice can be an issue without headphones only is noisy areas
No 3.5mm jack"
367,4 July 2019,Sudha,"Its jarring to listen,while on the call. Display sensonr is not working, when you dial for a call. Need support quickly from samsung services pleaseeee. when approched Samsung service center, they are happily saying motherboard issue. will change the motherboard at the use less than two months, it shows the credibility of the product. i have asked for replacement, but they are saying, they will change the motherboard. upon calling Samsungs' service.center, no proper response. They making me wait for a long to speak to the seniors, not a single time i could get them. Boldly, they say, we will arrange a call back. will certainly go to consumer court on this issue, if not replaced. Amazon, is also take.responsibilities, as they do take revenue from the sales. Any one else, on this issue, pls post it..."
368,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Voice quality very poor, hear double sound , plus phone does look like Samsung product , worst product in the name of Samsung, Amazon doesn't have a exchange policy, even after inspecting the phone and accepting the bad voice quality, Amazon is not ready to exchange it saying it's a manufacturer defect and cant be returned, They say it's a new technology, phone doesn't have a receiver and sound generates and vibrates from display, Absolutely dissatisfied with the product and in unprofessional approach of Amazon, Finally I had to sell it in the market value for lesser price, Buying phones from Amazon strictly not suggested. They seems to have different policy for phones and finally sufferers r the consumers purchasing it. Sad and shame Amazon."
369,30 July 2019,Bhanupriya,So....I'm using this phone from past 10 days.So here is what I feel about it...I've seen many negative comments regarding phone's on display sound technology..well what I feel is..the voice of the other person is clear and audible even in traffic. Camera clarity is good but could have been better.....phone's charging is really quick...but if you are using your mobile with net throughout the day then battery will last long upto 9-10hrs...I haven't faced any hanging or heating issues yet....the biggest drawback is phone doesn't have 3mm jack which means you cannot charge and listen to music at the same time..but still 3mm to type c converts are available in market which you can use to make the earlier thing possible....hope this helps!! Thank you 😊
370,28 June 2019,Vidhu,"Well , this is the first time I am using Samsung phone and honestly I waited for this phone due to its look and features. Overall it's a nice phone with no hang problem with many apps opens at one time so no issue with the performance. Camera is great but could have been better, wide camera is good. Front camera is giving decent results. Phone is smooth and face unlock and fingerprint unlock is fast. Battery is good and can last upto 16 to 18 hours as per your usage. Over all I can say it's a great buy at 20k range giving other options.

Two things could have been better battery and front camera."
371,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Naveen,Worst product ever from Samsung the sound quality is really very bad and phone gets heated up and if I ask for a replacement From the amazon app it asked me to install an other 3rd party app from my phone please checkout the pick which I have posted Samsung has manufactured as 6gb ram but in that application it shows like it has 8gb ram please don’t fool us kindly please refund the money
372,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Sanjeev,"Phone basic use to make a call and recived the call but in coming voice is very bad even distorion in the voice just like blur voice . i had requested the service request and he had also not able to sovle the problem as phone have the distortion voice nothing can't do more with setting so before making the plan to purcase should have good feedback about the phone ,"
373,2 October 2019,Atin,"First, let's talk about good things
I play heavy games with minimal disturbance, design looks elegant as far as other phones in this price range are concerned, I like camera of this phone also and fast charge
Now talk flaws
Sound quality is pathetic bcoz of on-screen speaker worst experiment by samsung, battery drains as fast as it gets charged, there is no 3.5 mm Jack in this phone which had to be present as this has so called on screen speaker.
Personally I would not recommend anyone to buy this phone and I bought it bcoz I only use samsung and I ordered it the day it was on amazon."
374,1 July 2019,parth vyas,"This device has some heating issues, fingerprint sensor is not very responsive battery drains fast & face detection is not that great either.
I don't know what material is used in back side but scratches can be seen even after carefully using it for two days.
However, it looks very nice, very slim and lightweight. Camera is very good, touch and display feels premium.
In display speaker thing doesn't feel very useful, as you have to keep volume on higher side to hear the other person on call, which make the conversation audible to other people seating near you."
375,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer,So..I've been using this phone for a week now....and lemme tell u the phone is pretty good by looks but is slippery ...as it doesn't comes with amoled screen but still works good..and camera it up to the mark only in daylight it somehow struggles in night ...but still by managing few settings u can take a awesome click...the speaker sound is load....and snap675 is not compatible with asphalt it hangs a lot on default settings.. The inscreen speaker is good but when the other person speaks the whole phone gives a bit of vibration ...I don't know only I'm feeling that maybe..the punch whole design ..damn it looks soo good that's the only point you will think its worth money...the battery works for a day I don't think it's that bad..and fast charging works well ..its a good package in 20k go for it..you won't regret
376,The manufacturer commented on the review below,sunny,"I purchased Samsung M40 as low budget phone will have all features like Oneplus7 but after ordered Samsung I realized it was a huge mistake as all pros and cons I'm writing.
Cons.
1.On call phones creates background or vibration sound which you will hate soon.
2.NFC feature is main issue which I'm facing as its malfunctioning with NfC sensor used for TYPE-1 Diabetic.
3.Heating issue.
4.Battery is very poor you need to Charge every day.

Overall I tried to return the product or exchange with Oneplus7 but Amazon is helpless to help his customers, as I'm 7 yrs of good experience with Amazon but all waste by buy Samsung M40.

Never ever buy from Samsung!!!"
377,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Soumya Mondal,"Battery is worst, doesnt support for 6 hours also if you use continuous internet, network reception is not good and fb crashes if operated from notifications."
378,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,Facing so many issues with the handset I received. Lift phone to wake up ( advanced gesture) not working. No notifications are visible on locked screen. We have tried all settings after talking to Samsung customer executive. Still unable to see any notification on locked screen. Battery is supposed to be a type c fast charging but still taking min 2hours to completely charge the phone
379,22 June 2019,SID Deshmukh,"Not a good product battery issue started in 1 days
Of delivery"
380,28 June 2019,Beta jk,"So far, it's amazing experience, truly OMG.. only concern is in respect with battery life, it's barely making whole day with moderate use . Hope amazon will give more options when it come to accessories

Pros.
Amazing headphones good sound
Good screen infinity o display is amazing
Face recognition and finger reader ia good a d responsive .
Value for money
Good gaming performance."
381,29 September 2019,Karthik,"Flop, waste, cheating , not worth, bad mobile.

Sound is not good while receiving calls. You will not hear anything properly , getting some vibrations, voice can hear from the well kind of echo. I have replaced the one which I bought then they gave another mobile which also having the same problems. I tried to replace this time but Amazon is not ready to do that , what a good deal? You can replace only one time if you have the same problems you have to live with that. Good policy! I hope Samsung top management should read and provide solution, I really don't know why Amazon is giving this product on online, my fate to buy this product . I enabled face recognition and tried for 5 times , battery dried immediately from 90% to 15%"
382,19 July 2019,Manas Sahoo,Purchased the handset during prime day sale..The phone build quality is awesome and really like the wide display. On screen sound technology is super and honestly the voice clarity is great. I was reading some user reviews before buying the product also confused but now I am happy after using M40..Samsung has lunched a stylish handset after a decade....just go for it..
383,The manufacturer commented on the review below,ABHISHEK KUMAR,"This is a pathetically designed phone from Samsung. I have used so many other models from Samsung, but this is just so bad. Techncially, battery drains out like hell. There is no punched holes on phone to hear while taking calls. Voice is generated inside handset and makes hearing very difficult. I wanted refund or replacement for phone, but Amazon denied it. It's a brand new phone and i am facing so many issues. I am not buying any further handsets from Amazon. Better ti buy from Samsung directly."
384,26 June 2019,ranveer,"I purchased this phone as a gift for my dad trusting amazon and Samsung.
Overall the phone looks good but when a person calls you the output of voice is very disappointing and also the phone gets heated up very quickly.
Also the battery life of the phone is very bad I look for a quick solution to the problem
Hoping amazon and Samsung solve the problem at the earliest"
385,11 August 2019,Amit,"Please don't waste your money.
The most horrible product from Samsung.
Worst camera
Poor battery life.
Poor build quality.
And TFT screen is also very bad.
The audio quality for handset and earpiece is very poor.
And the Amazon support, you will never gonna get any soulation from them.

I got the phone with defective screen. But they not going to listen."
386,7 October 2019,Rajesh J.,"Started heating in very first hour, Pathetic camera quality, very awkward front camera position, charging cable is too short may half a metre,cheap body quality, overall total waste of money, there are thousands of better options available in this price range. Very much disappointed"
387,6 August 2019,Harsh Virkar,"I found the device absolutley value for money. I am really impressed with the display quality as I was a bit sceptical about it as it is not a amoled but a TFT panel. Also the performance is great as I am not experiencing any lag. Also I liked the camera quality but sometimes low light photos are a bit disappointing. Also the fingerprint scanner works pretty good as it sometimes has problem in recognizing. It works really well but I would have liked if it gave a haptic feedback while unlocking. Also I didn't find any issues with the battery life of the device even though it has comparatively lower battery capacity as compared to other competitors. It still gives a day of moderate usage. Also I am really impressed with its rate of charging.
Overall, I thoroughly liked the device."
388,5 August 2019,Rahul,"I own this and it's like a month old so here's my review.
camera: triple cam 32mp shots good and wide angle shots too good outside environment.
front shooter's bit less quality since I've used tamper glass on the screen hence the camera.
processor: Impressive 675 snapdragon for Samsung device. Samsung's known for bad and laggy processors in its midrange lineup but the ram managements pretty good with this one with 6gb of ram and about 110gb usable storage makes it worth considering.
battery: comes with small nimble 3500mAh but trust me it lasts long for day with small usage since sd675 is pretty power efficient.
Not that heavy even after slapping a case in it. Inside the User Interface is so good. I personally prefer OneUI over colorUI, MiUI, EMUI or funtouchOS, since I've used others (many of them UI come with ads).
But you're paying bit extra for Samsung ""brand"""
389,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Sathya Kumar,The battery performance is very poor and it is taking more than two hours to charge 60-80% and definitely this is not what a individual/Customer is looking from technology giant Samsung and also the sound output is very ordinary where other brands are providing exceptional sound quality. As I am a valuable and proud customer of Amazon I'm definitely looking for solution(exchange) for this problem.
390,4 August 2019,Siddharth Singh,"1. Camera is below average, when zoomed it just messed up...but after updates it becomes just awesome.
2. Batery life is just ok.
3. Gaming on this phone is very awesome with no lags at all.
4. No heating issue.
5. Speaker is also fine...crisp and clear sound.
6. Calling is also fine.
7. Built quality and feel is premium.
8. No earphone jack but you'll get earphones with it.
9. Earphone quality is just amazing.
10. UI is also great with no lags and frame drop.
11. Besides its TFT display the display is actually very great...vibrant colors and immersive.
12. Front camera is average.
13. Value for money rating is 8/10.
GO FOR IT"
391,8 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Use this phone for about a month best thing about it is the display, phone look (built quality) rear camera is really good, fingerprint reader, face detection is good, internal storage and ram is good but the concerns are battery life for me an average user it last for full day but charging is really fast.
Before buying this phone I was bit concerned about the on screen speaker during calls but it is average and tends to vibrate but if you are using full volume if you down the volume problem will be resolved. Lovely headphone and Dolby atmos sound treat to listen.

All in all I have been and will be the Samsung user and will never prefer Mi and realme..

In this price range best to buy this phone and seawater blue is the best choice according to me because of innovative color combination."
392,29 June 2019,S D,"This is with regards to the product M 40 that I bought from Amazon.

I have been facing the issue of faulty earphone. I'm not able to hear anything clearly and it's more of echoing voice that comes out.

In noisy surrounding, I can't hear anything and it's difficult to use the phone that performs so bad in the basic necassity feature that the phone needs to have.

I tried contacting Amazon customer care and they are asking me to go to the service centre. The issue is that the product comes with a weeks replacement warrant and they are not Co sidering it.

I do not want to go to the service centre where I would loose the option for refund/replacement.

Please either refund my hard earned money or send over a replacement"
393,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"The battery is very pathetic and just dies down intermittently. In past 40 days we are getting battery dead auto switch-off for 3rd time in a row, its 10 days downtime and still in service center no use approaching COE deck, they see you as burden for 20,0000 invested, even 5,000 phones work more reliable. The pathetic, insensitive and cold customer service is making us lose trust in Samsung brand. Today 29 Aug its 16 days down with service center due to lack of parts and head office is still discussing on how to resolve , Its too much unorganised n unprofessional."
394,5 September 2019,Shashank Gowda,"Im using samsung phones with different models from past 9 years, nver had any issues in the initals but this phone today I have been recieved and started with some problem. First of all Finger print is not at all working properly and the sound clarity is very poor then Camera, though it contains 3 cam still stuggles to give clarity, battery average and 1 best thing is perfomance, very smooth and feels good to use the phone.

Finally never had this kind of worst experience from samsung phone. Very bad."
395,29 September 2019,Sreenath Sasi,"One of the worst camera in this price range. Any other budget phones less than 15000/- or 10000/- has better camera than this. I am still fighting with Samsung Service Center for the camera color reproduction issue, and Samsung is not very supportive in solving the problem. Just 15 days still not have any resolution.

I don't recommend any Samsung device from my personal experience."
396,26 June 2019,Rap Ambitions,"The phone is the best that I've used till date. The fingerprint sensor is really quick and so is the face unlock. Camera being a great thing about it,the 32MP camera gives a very good view of the things,the ultrawide lens gives a view that is almost what the human eye is able to see. The SSD technology is another great feature of it. Five stars seem to be less for this marvelous piece."
397,6 August 2019,Raviraj Gharat,"The phone looks good. Camera average. Yes at this price range Samsung should have provided AMOLED display.
The speaker under the display technology, I really don't know how much successful it is. Had hearing issues during call with the initial handset and also the replaced handset. The caller is also unable to hear my voice during call and this happened with the replaced handset as well. Somewhere in the reviews its written that the technician will come and check on the issue and yes i agree to it that this is really frustrating. A customer wont be returning a product for the 2nd time without it being a genuine problem. Was totally unexpected from Samsung. Amazon is co-operative and I hope i get replacement again for this defective handset."
398,29 June 2019,Mubarak Pendari,"I am using this phone from last 10 days there is no issue with performance and the camera quality is excellent. No issue with security, fingerprints scanner and face reading is so accurate in this device. Battery performance is also good eventhough the battery capacity is 3500mah, due to its processor which optimizes the battery consumption. The only thing I am missing in this phone is 3.5 mm headphone Jack, because I have JBL earphones of 3.5 mm jack which I am unable to use them now. And also Samsung have not provided back cover in box for safety and back covers are not available in local markets also still I am using phone without back cover. Overall the phone is good value for money Samsung did good job this time i really impressed with it."
399,12 August 2019,kumtii,"I really like this phone. The look and feel is great . I dont mind having one point with the charger and the earpiece in one place . The problem here I have lost my ear piece. And I bought several ear pieces with USC c type aswell as some ejecter ..but none of them works . Charging is working but when I try the other ear pieces but it not work.. at all
I'm sure not every earpiecs that I bought it's not defected .. so I'm sure there must be something wrong with the phone.

I'm guessing only the original sa.sung earpieces works
And I dont mind buying them at all but the problem is I'm not even getting the original piece online aswell

Not I'm stuck with this phone with no earpiece

I need help with this"
400,25 June 2019,Krishna,"The sim tray is not opening, so I couldn't not use the phone after purchasing it. After 5 days technicians visit and confirmed it is a defect piece."
401,24 June 2019,Safiya,"Overall performance of the phone is impressive. It's quite fast and responsive. Sleek design and o infinity display add more desirability and excellence to the phone. Highlighting the positive points, Camera works amazing in both rear and primary, Fast Charging going fine, speaker and Type c earphones are premium in quality terms. But comparing the phone with other samaung mid range phones it lacks samsung knox secure features where no option is available to the users for masking apps and or secure their contents in secure folders. Samsung pay option is also missing in the phone. Rest, phone is attractive, feels premium, No heating issues while using or on charging.Except 2-3 down points mentioned above phone is stellar and worth buying."
402,5 August 2019,shibananda c.,"It's a near perfect combination of what I wanted in my new phone. I must mention the display and camera are awesome. It captures the real colours and not some fake effects. A larger battery could have been even better. Separate finger print scanner is always more responsive than on display one, the later one is of course more fancy. The only missing thing is a 3.5mm jack."
403,9 August 2019,Sandesh,In baught this phone on prime days with exchange of redmi note 5 pro @10138₹ only . But M40 is real tatti phone too much laging issue never experienced it's 6gb ram phone ... Even 4gb+64gb of redmi note 5 pro have best performance .... Don't buy if your are a heavy user
404,The manufacturer commented on the review below,pramodkumar.koli,"I have been using this mobile for a week now. It has6GB RAM and 128GB internal memory. Storage and display is good. It looks same as S10E, but Quality wise it’s very delicate. You will get the plastic on the backside which I personally didn’t like it. When it comes to performance, 70% of the time it hangs. Some times Sound goes on mute. You have to restart it rest the phone to get it fixed. Overall definitely not worth 20K. You have lot of options which might be better than this."
405,26 June 2019,DAYANAND LOHAR,"Very Good phone in this price range.
Lot Happy with phones performance so far
Camera quality is highlight of this phone, it clicks great picture even in low light
Face unlock works faster than i could have imagined
Good display quality (As i watch lots of web series on my phone so liked it more)
On my personal view it would have been great if fingerprint reader were on front side (although on back side is not an issue)
Battery life is is just good as it is just 3500 mAh, could have been better phone with 4000-5000 mAh, as in this age were people spend most of their time on phone so this could have given us extra few hours before we plug in charger.
HAPPY WITH OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF SAMSUNG M40"
406,27 June 2019,SABARY NATH,"The best ever phone that one with a medium level budget can buy.
Samsung has come up with its exquisite expertise to deliver the best ever experience to its middle class buyers. Though a medium level class in price the phone has an ultra luxurious impact on for the customers. The new Samsung PLS tft display will give you an experience far better as that of super amoled. The Snapdragon processor has made the performance on to an extra magnificent level. The new game play mode will give an optimised playing experience. The sound quality in the Samsung is far beyond that cab be expressed. The triple camera setups will deliver the utmost catchy apperances on the image output. All together the best mid-range Samsung Smartphone."
407,27 June 2019,Anand Singh Rawat,"1. Excellent phone with great design and premium looks
2. seawater blue design is awesome and shines better than glass in sunlight
3. Camera is ok for a 20 k phone and 6 + 128 gb variant
4. Smooth and fluid using experience
5. Very light weight and lot less slippery than glass back mobiles
6. Battery is good as claimed 3500 MAH but lacks headphone jack port
7. Good gaming experience but due to absence of 3.5 mm jack charging+playing not available
8. Samsung one UI is great and clean
9. Camera does not have night mode but I think Samsung will update it later on
10. Little bit costlier but it is Samsung
WANT TO GIVE IT 4 AND 1/2 BUT AMAZON ONLY PROVIDES 4 OR 5
SO I GIVE 5🤗"
408,25 June 2019,Shree Ram Malani,"The phone has an excellent design and build. It feels very good to hold and use. The seawater color was way beyond my expectations. It is simply beautiful.
The phone is snappy and smooth but I need time to get used to the One UI after using stock android.
The camera is just average. The back camera is slow and the front camera beautifies the photo automatically, which I did not like.
The most disappointing aspect of the phone is its battery. With 3500 mAh, the phone gets past for only 1 day, my usage being very light as its my secondary phone. Its battery maybe compared with my iPhone 7!!!"
409,26 June 2019,Wasim c.,"SAMSUNG the name that every phone company fears and yet it has prroved itself again by beautiful series of smartphones into thee budget criteria for every normal citizen who dreamt of a snapdragon processor but couldnt purchase one due to over the roof prices Samsung the ever trusted company which phones you can repl on as it has gained trust of people through the course of time
Samsung M40 is no exception!
The beautiful punch hole OMG display with a truly reliable processor with a truly good camera in the budget section with hyperlaspe and slowmotion capabilities doesn't leave us without a smile without an second thought of putting into our money for this
I wish samsung to maintain this quality forever"
410,27 June 2019,Vipin Sharma,"Its osome phone in this price band. Fingerprint reader, face unlock is pretty good and fast enough.
Screen sound technology is also wonderful. Especially when you are sweating there is no chance of moisture going inside. 5star for that.
Battery life could be little more, but it's good for whole day work and watching videos.

Camera quality also good."
411,22 July 2019,Fahad,"I switched to Samsung from Chinese manufacturers recently and bought M40 and i had to say ...what an amazing device it is. Especially the performance.SD 675 and 6gb Ram is a god combination.The display is not comparable with an Amoled but it's the best non Amoled display in the market.The fingerprint sensor is accurate and fast (could be a little bit faster).
Now coming to the camera..I found the stock camera a little disappointing but when i downloaded the GCAM...the pictures were fricking beautiful...the Wide angle camera on the stock is the best tho.
Battery may disappoint some people but the SD675 is an efficient process and can give you a day long battery life easily.
Its a really amazing device."
412,The manufacturer commented on the review below,sanjeev,"My phone is getting heated during conversation.The app is running very slow.
When i contacted the amazon technical team ,they are just giving idiotic advise and did not provide me any solution at all. Every time they are just using the hit and trial method to provide solution.
They are doing false promise of 10 day replacement,this is the worst experience of amazon brand."
413,14 August 2019,sai,Me and my friend purchased this new Samsung phone. and with minimal use the screen has got shattered. We've used Samsung phones previously and this is the first time we're saddled with such a fragile and flimsy model. It seems I have spent my hard-earned money on a substandard device. I'm so upset. After saving for 2 years I saved enough to buy this and along with the screen my dreams and hopes have been shattered to small small pieces. You people have no value for my sweat and tears. You're associating with such a poor and cheap model and losing the trust of loyal customers.... I'm definitely not going to buy any Samsung devices ever....
414,28 June 2019,SATYAA,"Pros:
Good rear camera
Good display
Fast fingerprint sensor
Software
Modern design (Punch hole display)
Cons:
Poor selfie camera(Specially in low light)
Poor battery life
Poor sound quality(In earphone it is good)"
415,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Vas,Not good.Cannot hear calls clearly. Lot of vibration heard when receiving or making calls. Amazon does not have refund facility and only talks of replacement. Tech support decision will be final and they expect to say device is fine only. The app installed to check diagnostics says 8 GB ram where as actually it is 6gb which proves their diagnostics app is also flawed
416,1 July 2019,Vadiraj,Samsung M40 is a very good phone to buy at Rs 20000 Price point. The Finger print Reader is located at the back and is very fast. I have used this securely with all banking applications to. The Camera is Good. Though I need to try it out extensively. I use this phone for all day to day transactions and along with mobile MS office is an extension to my PC. I use the free Sophos App for further securing the Phone. All in all Samsung M40 is a great phone
417,21 August 2019,gokul,Camera is too smoothy . Afterctaking pic image is too shady .worst sharpness .this is not a premium one .juat having a camera .only one advantage is good looking in punch hole display .and samsung brand in low cost .while calling display vibrates and it emits heat .yhen after taking 30 photos continuously phone is getting too hot in back top corner.then finger print is okay when you use back case .face unlock is too slow and now i thinking they are working in update .in my point of view its okay to buy for 6gb ram 128gb rom . And for normal use its okay .gaming is good but heating issue is there .
418,26 June 2019,Munish,"Its been few days for using M40, hence sharing my experience,
Pros:-
Great picture clarity.
Touch works very smooth.
Finger print sensor and face recognition works faster.
Camera quality is excellent except ultra wide mode.
Very sleek design and light weight.

Cons:-
On screen voice for incoming call is not clear, whereas it works fine on HD calling.
Can't use headphone while charging as1 c type input available
Pictures are not that much clear on Ultra wide mode.
Battery cap shd be more than 4000 MAH.

So, overall phones delivers exceptionally well in this range."
419,16 October 2019,Amit Trivedi,I am giving this review after three months of usage. This phone contains a bug nd has charging issues. I have taken the phone twice to service center and paid 1500 charges for that. Samsung is a cheat on this model M 40. U can check it yourself. Worst phone of my life
420,7 July 2019,ASHUTOSH SINGH CHAUHAN,"I'm facing below two issues since day 1 :
1. Clicking on facebook notification is not lending to the the facebook app, it doesn't opens Facebook App at all.
2. Clicking Inshorts notification is not lending to the news shown in notification, even it lends to the 1st news everytime.

I have tried writing many times to support, but not getting any resolution.
They are just asking me to update latest base band version, which is already updated.

Don't know what type of testing has been done on this phone, as this is not the device specific issue, this issue persists for all the devices of this model as one of my friend is facing the same issue as i'm."
421,25 July 2019,Abhishek Chaturvedy,"Overall Good , but camera could have been better . Display is fantastic . Punch hole looks good gives extra screen space .
even a budget Mi A1 could capture better pictures than this.
The O advertisement was just much hyped. O Infinity blah blah.."
422,1 October 2019,Sankar,"SPEAKER / AUDIO is the biggest concern. Might, it be a new technology of audio behind the complete screen instead on the phone head, but its completely not audible if you stepping outside, mainly on roads where their is little noisy. Also its getting echo while on open speaker without headset. Phone is good when we use on headset, but its not possible to be on headset every-time & wherever we GO. Except Audio, rest all features and Quality of this Phone is good, only disappointed on the Audio. However, THANKS to Amazon to return the money considering our request post delivering the replacement item which has the same issue."
423,7 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Price wise what you are getting is good. If you are not a camera lover then you can buy galaxy m30 with a battery of 5000mah. There is software flaw in this phone. I replaced the first one and the problem is same in this one also. Some apps don't open from notification panel like daily hunt which is preinstalled, Facebook, maps. Either the app crashes or screen is just white. Not a major issue but I am not able to decide whether I keep the phone or return it again. Other wise the touch, finger sensor, camera, screen everything is great."
424,16 August 2019,Vinoth Karunanidhi,"Basic quality of any smartphone or basic model phone is Call quality. Now a days, telephone industries are advertising and marketing only for triple camera, Amoled scree, battery this much and that much and , RAm Capacity and memory capacity and worst part is selfie camera. Does any one focus on call quality which is primarily basic quality of phone. Being a samsung user for a very long time, with lot of hope, i got this phone. I can speak only by putting speaker.when you are alone in a room with pin drop silence also you cannot hear what others speak over the other end. Literally both oncoming and outgoing call quality is terrible. Please think before getting this phone."
425,24 June 2019,Krishna Nand Pandey,"I am writing this review for phone after using 1 week.
Pros
1.Good camera both front and rare
2. Fast finger and face sensor
3. Good fast charging
4. Display awesome
5. Processor works fast

Cons

1. Very less battery life
2. Slippery phone
3. On screen speaker is making lot of viberation and sound is also not clear"
426,28 September 2019,sgs,"Tbe audio thru type c Jack is minusfor this product. No adopter works with this audio port. Where as the converter works with other models having audio type port. This is the great disadvantage of this fone.

For this you can go for some other better model."
427,9 July 2019,Amazon Customer,The design is good .. No AMOLED screen for this price tag while M30 are having AMOLED displays..Unnecessary Battery drain(Screen on tym is very less) ... I was impressed with Ultra wide camera Lens ... I want this phone to have glass sandwiched Aluminum frame like A50 does as it has the similar price tag ... Performance is ok .. but the materials used concerns durability .. time tells how this mobile stands when it comes to performance and any software issues as samsung are known to take more time to release software updates ...
428,28 June 2019,shakeer,"I have been using this phone for over 15 days and I'm absolutely satisfied with this product
Here are some pros and cons according to me
Pros:-
1. infinity O display at this price range
2. Snapdragon 675 processor is so fast and I'm not facing any lagging problem.
3. Triple camera picture quality is so good comes with 4k recording and front camera is superb
4. Latest screen sound technology and it is so clear
5. Comes with type-c fast charging port
6. It has FHD+ display which has excellent display quality can't find difference with super-amoled

Cons:-
1. It does not have headphone jack.
2. It comes with 3500mah which is average."
429,28 June 2019,Udit Bhadauria,"The phone is just awesome. The screen quality is truly awesome 409 ppi gives an smooth and crystal clear screen. Fingerprint reader is really fast. And the best thing is camera. Super slow motion recording could be able to record even rain drops. That is truly amazing. As the battery capacity 3500 mAH the battery backup is more than sufficient. And I am having an amazing experience in games like asphalt and pubg because of the powerful procesor phone have. The punch hole design give me feel like I'm using S10. And most importantly in just 20k, Samsung is giving truly premium design phone. It is a must buy Phone. I'm really satisfied with my device."
430,26 October 2019,Amazon Customer,Pathetic product ...PL don't buy anything from Amazon...the product was defective and it's been more than one week I am struggling to return back and Amazon is just fooling
431,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Topden Bhutia,"Camera is not good..at all..
Battery life is worst so cheap...
And u dont know...my calling speaker is not working ..out of nowhere...it has been damaged... automatically..... so bhakwass phone...i lost my money and time..

...i would give zero rating...fix my phone Samsung... I would never prefer Samsung to any one ..
Heating problem,battery back up is extremely pathetic."
432,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ghatiya Camera do not buy,"Worst Camera it's just like 15 MPXL..
Captured picture is just like apply a filter..
And size or photos is below 4MB ..
No background information showing in any photo clearly after very less zoom..
I compared with 13mp camera and both 32MP and 13Mp having almost same Quality.. if I increase Britness level in13MP camera .. ghatiya Camera he ek dam"
433,2 July 2019,Srilekha Lokanathan,"So worth the price. The camera quality, finger print scanner are quite good for the price. The battery life idle pretty okay.
Love the display. The functions of the phone are pretty fast too. It is slim and quite easy to hold n use. Seems a little on the delicate side. One thing I like about samsung phones being they usually have no issues or glitches at least for 3 or 4 years. This is one main reason I prefer Samsung over any other brands."
434,3 September 2019,Sri peddada,"A good one... my last phone was a9 pro2016.. i liked it very much it ws sturdy and all, this is also good with new features, in display i wish there was warmer hue in this phone, like in a9pro which is very comfy fr eyes, even nw i feel a9 gives more premium feel compared to this, time will tell me more abt it.. i wish battery was 4000 mah but good enough fr this price(fast charger is a plus ) type c cable for earphones is okay with me, i hope its available in stores.(not that i knw) nevertheless storage is a plus and new phone is always new phone."
435,15 July 2019,Harsh Chhatwal,"Although there is no 3.5mm headphone jack but the type c earphones provided in the box are just lit. Battery, though 3500 mah but if you limit the background process of google you will not need to recharge it untill 12 hours. Display is not super amoled but the color and contrast is very good. It's display is very crisp. And moreover it has nfc which is a life savior when it comes to transfer photos from camera to phone. If fingerprint reader is not coverd properly it doesn't say no match, it rather commands to cover it properly. It also works if your hands are sweaty. If you need this for gaming this thing is an absolute beast!!"
436,1 July 2019,ANISH MARKOSE,I have been using M40 for 2 weeks. The performance has been excellent. The Display is bright and Vivid giving good quality video. The Camera performance is also good but not the Best. The battery is OK for a Days to use. Do not expect anything more than that. Build quality is also good. The display is the main attraction of the phone with a small notch for a front camera at the up corner of the Display. The processor is quick and fast.. I have not experienced any heating issues with the phone. I am using NOKIA 8.1 also. But I will give one star up for NOKIAs camera and HD Display. But at this price range Samsung does a good Job.
437,27 July 2019,Rajan Kumar vishwakarma,"I like this product m40 at the price range 19,990 good phone good quiltyy and camera is good picture front and rear is good working clearty is good but 🔋 battery backup is low I dout is my phone battury 8and 9 hrs backup Use And front camera is picture not clear Jhilmilahat Jaisa recieo type picture a raha picture not clear"
438,16 July 2019,Ravi,"Eye catching design from display side, particularly with camera embedded in screen itself, it looks good. Battery life is good and charging speed is preety fast. I think it's good phone in less than 20k price.

Cons: while charging or while using earphone phone get bit slow.
Single Jack for both charging and earphone, and charging port type is not of common design."
439,9 August 2019,Amazon Customer,The build and performance are decent. Some echo observed during calls. The lack of a 3.5 mm stereo Jack is an irritant if you want to connect your phone to other audio devices or other headphones. The type C to Stero jack connectors in the market are not quite compatible for this device. Samsung should introduce adapters quickly.
440,23 June 2019,Luv Chulania,There is lack in this phone . The camera is not upto the mark . It is 32 mp camera but its seems like only 12 mp camera. The Phone is very fast n has very large storage thats n attractive point but we can buy other phones with almost better or same features at a better price than this. We should go for poco F1 or Galaxy A50 insted of Galaxy M40.
441,26 June 2019,Manandeep Bhardwaj,"Best smartphone , infinity O display made it more attractive . Camera Quality is best . Fast fingerprint , face reader and it's battery life is awesome 1 day14 hours on power saving mode . In mostly reviews i found that they're asking that not having headphones jack is the disadvantage but according to me it is the advantage of it . I suggest you too go for it . It is the best mobile phone with these features in this range ."
442,26 June 2019,Surya,"Awesome phone, this is my first android phone. I have been avoiding android phones for these many years. But the pin hole camera, the seawater blue coloured with glossy finish triggered me too but this phone . But I will never regret buying it. The smart features provided by Samsung takes this phone one step higher. Cameras looks perfect and the processing speed is very good without and lag. On a whole this is definitely a Millenial package"
443,8 September 2019,Rajesh challa,"very good product ,all the features are well functioning and use full to me .i am unsatisfied with to reasons 1) battery life and capacity 2) notification light system -not present ,--better to have notification light system.
any how i am satisfied with camera features."
444,30 July 2019,umesh,"Performance is good
Display quality good
Build quality just about average
On screen sound below average
Battery below average ,I dont have any game on my phone , but then too I have to charge twice with full 100% to get away with battery
Camera also below average
One main problem is I have tried many usb type c to 3.5mm headphone connector but none of them worked I dont know what's the issue but seriously it sucks

Many other good phones are available other than this , I dont recommend this phone to anyone please buy some other phone"
445,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"It has Good display , sharp amd good color balance , has Fast charging and no overheating .Camera is good in bright light. Looks great. But has short battery life inspite of 3500mah. Onscreen
N speaker is not very clear. And has c- type earphone Jack which is a lil drawback.

1. Short battery life
2. No amoled
3. Carrier aggregation is limited to 2CA i.e. 2x2 MIMO(should have been 3CA at this price but its Samsung)
4. On screen speaker is not good. Voices are getting muffled
5. Glitches heard while listening to music using type c earphones as soon as i touch the onscreen home button"
446,7 August 2019,Srinivasan B,"Previously I gave a very good feedback on this phone. This is my first non-chinese phone and thought Samsung will be good. I am not a gamer. I only use it for communications. I see that this phone data gets disabled during voice call. This really is causing serious problems in attending online meetings etc, while keeping the WiFi hotspot on. Need a proper response from Samsung or its nothing but cheating all the customers. Any one could see this problem when they talk through earphones, else will assume data is enabled. My old Lenovo phone is fat better than this crap."
447,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"worst selfie camera ever, Samsung should be ashamed of themselves, even a phone under 5k-10k price range has a better selfie camera"
448,2 July 2019,Muralee Senthilventhan,I found good phone. Overall quality is great. Battery life with in 20 minutes enough to charge it full capacity. And RAM speed is quite very well.. I know Samsung brand is always unique. I know Samsung can manufactur more upgraded phones. I never miss out for new product of Samsung.. I love to have and even in full screen it is good to study in large wide screen and movie quality is also great seen in M40.I don't use finger print because I feel it can't safe.. But technology is moving so I feel good go and use of sensors is different level of opening. Thank you Samsung.
449,20 July 2019,Pulin Mehta,No separate slot for SD Card. It was mentioned clearly in specifications and advertisement.Battery life very poor. Have to charge twice in a day. No separate Jack for headphones!!! C type charger slot for head phone. It's non standard set up. Overall not happy with product.Some gestures and shortcuts also missing.Network issue. Same sim is showing full network in Mi phone.
450,The manufacturer commented on the review below,VIVEK PANDEY,"Camera quality is very poor ,don't but"
451,1 July 2019,Sudhanshu sahu,"Things I liked the most ÷
1.the punch hole display it's just innovative and sometimes people confuse it with samsung galaxy s10 E so you can show off
2. Performance is great Snapdragon chipset gave it invincible speed
3.Camera quality is also great and wide angle is really wide
4.when you turn on the flash the borders kind of emits light which is kind of innovative

Things I didn't like
1.it doesn't have secondary screen like samsung galaxy A50 which my friend have it gives the phone the premium look

This is my honest review from my point of view.. hope you like it"
452,20 October 2019,Siva,"I am writing this review after using more than 2 months One of the worst phone I have , battery life is very poor it will be discharged clvery fastly not even one day for one full charge only for browsing less than 2 hours and no gaming and video plays. Camera quality is average. Wifi is very poor it's not showing/connecting router less than 30 meters one room away. I have oppo phone there IAM seeing signal strength of wifi is excellent and with same router M40 phone connects very few times that too with poor signal strength,I totally disappointed with the phone mainly with wifi connection and battery life"
453,The manufacturer commented on the review below,SenthilKumar N,"Please dont buy this mobile. Honestly not worth 20K.
The basic function of call is not met. The screen speaker is not clear and vibrates. Leave in a crowded place, even in a calm clear room, you have to extra vigilant to hear the other speaker.Camera is pathetic no auto-focus and even subject with focus looks blurred."
454,21 August 2019,Yash kumar,"This has a problem in internal working because in lock screen mode, it lags when we change the wallpapers and when we open the settings at that time on screen display automatic click inside screen happens and other thing is that when we want to edit pictures from albums, photos doesn't edit. It is a very big disadvantage in this phone and there is a one more problem that in the dark whenever I use the phone the two problems happen- the first one is the circle camera light appears on above camera and the second problem is the display brightness on the lock screen wallpaper is not working properly."
455,27 June 2019,Deepak,"This phone deserves much better rating but i am giving it only one star because of the Samsung india team which is calling me again and again to write the review on amazon. I am getting these calls every hour so, Samsung India this is my review.. Hope u like it."
456,The manufacturer commented on the review below,rahul mor,Overheating warning comes in just half hour shareit transfer and screen mirroring. In display sound is not good. Camera is below average.
457,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Tejas,"No fast charging. It takes more than 2 and half hour to fully charge. Battery lasts only for 4-5 hours, camera are also an average. Not much user freindly compared to Gionee and other Chinese brands."
458,14 July 2019,saurabh raut,"I gifted the phone to my sister and she is too much happy with it ...
Pros is its good battery life, and its superb display with rapid fast finger print sensor and fabulous camera picture quality.
Just little improvement need in image stabilization and face recognition is little slower than other competitors in the segment.
One must consider this phone with budget of 15 to 20k."
459,29 June 2019,"Rao, KV","Battery cycle not enough for a day. So, battery performance is poor. Rest all are ok. I was disappointed with screen voice. When receive or make a call in the crowd or in bazaar, it is a little bit difficult to here the voice. Hence, I am using bluetooth"
460,22 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"This is a perfect device feom samsung. The phone camera is 32 M but picture quality seems to be ok. But in this range this is best phone.
Touch is very smooth.
Amazon same day delivery by paying 100 rs is worth."
461,22 August 2019,sonam,"Dear Amazon Team,

I bought this phone for one of my friend lives in UAE as a gift and i realize when he tried to use it in UAE that this is only work in INDIA.There was no information at the site when i was buying it. And it is a common understanding that a phone will work anywhere in the world and the Phone is now in UAE can't be used.

My Question Is why it was not mentioned at the product description at your website?
and What is the solution here now?

It was a gift and i have no words now to the person whom i gifted.

Regards
Sonam"
462,15 September 2019,Ankita,"Screen on this phone is huge. Great picture quality and great camera shutter speed for fast photography. I love the front camera placement. It does not block view while watching in full screen. Fingerprint scanner is also great feature, but I have stopped using it because my finger naturally rest on the scanner and I open my phone unknowingly, which was a bit irritating, although my father loves this feature in his phone"
463,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Shaik Usman Basha,"Heating, battery drain vary fast, not locking good, Camara quality very bad don't buy this mobile. Please refund my money"
464,26 June 2019,NP,Finally I think Samsung got their mid segment phone combination right. Though you miss amoled display however punch hole display works just fine. Working smooth with decent battery life. If it's within your budget go for it instead of cheap Chinese products.
465,29 June 2019,Niranjan Kumar," Finger Print reader works fine as well as the face unlock. Camera quality is very good and slow motion, ultra slow motion are top notch. Battery life is good as it is a 3500mAh, works fine for a complete day of usage of internet, videos. If games like PUBG are played it stays for 3-4 hours.
Perfect phone for 20000/- from Samsung with 6GB Ram and 128GB memory. I guess this is the first phone from Samsung with so many features in such affordable price and that is one of the reason we brought it immediately on the day of Amazon sale."
466,The manufacturer commented on the review below,vivek,"Pros:
1. Very good performance.
2. Excellent multi tasking.

Cons:
1. Very bad camera. Improved a bit with the latest update, but still not up to the mark as it was expected from Samsung.
2. Battery life is very poor. Struggles to survive a day. On video call battery drains very very fast.
3. While using the phone on charge touch becomes unresponsive sometimes. And same happens without charge also.
4. Finger print and rear camera region becomes super hot after continuous usage for 1 hour.

So I will consider this as waste of money."
467,8 August 2019,akash K.,"My honest answer phone is actually good lots of people complaining and all but I'm compare this phone like redmi, realme. This phone display actually good as compared to other you never tell this is TFT display. To much closer to LED display.Overall phone is actually good like camera and all. In display sound is really doing job great but it's depend person by person. If you looking 20k phone this is good choice but it's also depend person by person actual Samsung os is really good"
468,2 August 2019,DILIP KRISHNA,"Pros :
Supports high end games.
Rear camera is good
Battery life is good when you don't use for gaming for much
Cons:-
Battery life was little less than expected , drains fast when you play PUBG like games.
Front camera is not good in low light
Screen touch sensitivity is little less when compare to high end mobile.
Mobile gets heat when you play high end games

Overall very good at this price range for whom want to experience the high end games now and then but not to often. Rest other futures are good for office going people."
469,29 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Actually this phone is a complete package by Samsung except few things like battery, headphone Jack only.
Pros:
1) fingerprint reader is fast
2) camera quality is good
3) punch hole display is awesome in this price range by Samsung
4) 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage is so good
5) snapdragon 675 is more powerful
6) screen sound technology is awesome
Cons:
1) 3500mah battery is little less
2) no headphone Jack
3) TFT display but if we compare amoled and TFT display side by side then only we can see the difference between both display."
470,The manufacturer commented on the review below,NITIN AGARWAL,I hv purchsed it on first sale. But I m very much disappointed with this mobile.Not gud mobile.voice quality is soo bed that u can't talk in just a noisy environment.battery is soo poor.total waist of money.
471,14 August 2019,AGS,"A really good phone for the price it's available at.
Camera is pretty good and the clarity is much better than my previous phone's (Lenovo K5 Note).
The screen size is quiet big which is good for watching movies/shows etc.
Storage is also really good at 128gb. I've always had an issue with this and had to always extend using a micro SD card. Not anymore..
CPU speed is pretty good. So far I haven't encountered any lags or hanging.
I got it for a great deal at 13.5k with exchange so very happy with my phone overall."
472,22 June 2019,Sweta,"Good one, good packaging, delivered in a day,... evrythings looks fine. But the smartphone do not have earpiece ..... the sound is not clear at all... you need to put on the headphone if the person on the other side is talking in low voice. This is not expected ... from a brand like Samsung.. to develop a phone whose main purpose is calling... and the phone fails in this."
473,17 August 2019,Isaq,"Amazingly performing phone with great camera for memories to cherish. Great battery life to meet full day need, my earlier moto G5S plus needed two charge for day in this I can manage with single charge. With fast charging you don't need battery bank to carry along."
474,27 June 2019,Nitish Ranjan,"The phone runs flawlessly....some of the functions like screen sound, Dolby Atmos, night mode and picture in picture function stands out.
Face recognition runs perfectly.... picture and sound quality is awesome.
Battery is 3500mah, which I felt was a bit less...but fast charging makes it even .
Camera quality is above avg...auto focus takes a little time.
Fingerprint sensor is also good.
Infinity'O'display is just beautiful.
Total value for money."
475,15 July 2019,Sonu Jha,"Fingerprint reader - needs improvement.
Camera - Biggest drawback is front camera not giving original pictures even in sunny day lights.
Battery life is good as per capacity of battery mentioned by Samsung."
476,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Subhrajyoti dhal,It is getting heat when using internet
477,28 June 2019,Anil Kumar,"Writing this review after using it for more than a week.
Pros
Display,
Touch...feeling like feather lite
Fingerprint unlock is faster,
Punch Hole Camera,
Sleek design and Low weight

Cons
Battery could have been given more capacity like 4000mah or 4500mah.
Screen Sound Technology. If you keep full volume while calling, you can fell vibration in front and back side of mobile.
Type C port for both charging and earphones. Cannot use both at same time."
478,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Camera- Both the cameras are very poor quality.
Call voice - Not really good. You can't really hear the voice clearly.
Design and Display- Its just fine. Not great though for a 20k phone.
In all, Its not worth half the price of it. I won't recommend it to anyone."
479,16 October 2019,Priyanka,"Very bad product.
Motherboard failed within 5 months of usage
Phone gets heated up quick and battery doesn't last half a day. Headphones and charging point in a single port is a huge drawback cuz headphones don't work all the time.
When I visited a Samsung service centre the place was filled with so many customers with similar issues in the M series range
Don't go for Samsung's middle range/budget phones.
Simply waste of money."
480,The manufacturer commented on the review below,PP,"Bought this product with so much enthusiasm, but very disappointed with the performance.
1. The new technology of having the earpiece on the display of the phone does not work for me. I'm not able to hear anything during calls. This is very frustrating & irritating. I have to say ""pardon me"" a 1000 times to every caller that call me or whom I call. Very bad!
2. The battery life is pathetic. It drains like a broken mud vessel. Just cannot accept a battery like this."
481,29 July 2019,Vikas Landage,"I bought Samsung M40 before a week and it has speaker problem. So I placed a order to replacement. The Amazon technician came to checked phone and he said Samsung M40 phone itself has a speaker problem so if you replace it the another phone will also have same problem. So this not a problem, all Samsung M40 have same issue and he sent feedback as phone don't have any problem. And denied my replacement order.

So people who want to buy this phone please change your mind.

Very disappointing from Samsung mobile."
482,18 August 2019,Vinayak Jhawar,"Finger print sensor sometimes does not work need to enter the unlock code in such cases.
Phone has started to hang which should not happen with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage, have to restart the phone in such cases.
Camera quality is good, can give 4 stars for it...I would say my earlier A7 had a better camera where the photo quality is much better."
483,23 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Infinity O display is amazing.
It is Widevine L1 certified, can watch Full HD Netflix and Prime.
Battery is decent, works for a full day with moderate use. Can extend it to day and a half with minimal usage.
Coming from a stock Android experience, One UI is decent and looks good.
Fast Charging with this phone is good. Other reviews seem to exaggerate the heat while charging, it does heat up like any other devices with fast charging.

Cons:
No AMOLED, M30 at a similar price point has one.
Battery could have been 4000 mAh"
484,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Balamurugan,"I bought this Samsung M40 last Friday (05.07.2019) and am extremely disappointed with the battery and performance.
The battery life is extremely worse and totally very disappointment.
The camera performance awesome.
Its does have screenshot menu and Samsung mobile Always on Display is missing
In market below 15k mobiles have good battery, camera and best performance too.
But this M40 totally disappointed/upset me as I am a phone addict
This mobile Rs.20000/- is not value for money its just waste of money"
485,The manufacturer commented on the review below,prasidha,Product is not up to the mark..Audio quality is very poor..Battery drains very fast. Complete wastage of money
486,4 July 2019,Sunil Nakum,"Overall great package, except the speaker quality. Note the speaker for playing media has good quality sound problem is with the speaker to make calls. Since the call speaker is tucked under the display, the voice quality is compromised. I mean you can hear the sound but the volume is quite low, may be because of the screen guard that we stick onto the screen. But it's not comparable to even any basic feature phone.

For those who need to make lot of calls and that too from outdoor, it's a strict no no phone. Otherwise a great all rounder phone."
487,4 July 2019,Keshav,Waste of money don't buy this mobile....worst service from Amazon..... I said I want to return this mobile after seeing mobile but Amazon executives saying that you can replace the mobile but u can't return or refund for it....worst service form Amazon....frustrated with their service...immediately I am deleting the app from my phone
488,27 June 2019,Yashwanth reddy,"I think this is the best samsung smart phone in this price range. It has got some new technologies like screen sound casting and hole punch camera.with the triple rear camera (32mp main) it shots good pictures, it also has many good camera features lije qide angle, bokeh, night mode, etc. Display was awesome as it has super Amoled display. Coming to the performance, the pwrformance of this phone is quite good, it has snapdragon 636 processor and andreo 6l2 Gpu. Battery is the main drawback of this mobile. With all the new high end specifications the battery which was given is not sufficient, atleast more than 4000 mah battery is suggested"
489,22 June 2019,indira soni,Very beautiful phone.....nic performance and good camera but if it has headphone Jack then it should be better
490,17 July 2019,HrudayH,"Good camera
Great Haptic feed back from vibrator motor
(as much as s10 series)
Feels premium but not premium
Overall its a good device but Buy only if it comes under 15k with offers and exchange discount."
491,13 September 2019,HARDIK,"I am very disappoint from Samsung request to every one not to buy this phone.
Samsung has decrease their quality product, not get specification given by then battery life not more than 4 hour.
camera quality is bad.if anyone want to this product i can sell pl contact to me -9829361450 with lowest price -16000/-"
492,29 June 2019,Heeraram Pal,"1. The screen is pretty good and you also get a punch hole camera in this budget which is unbelievable.
2. The 32mp rear camera is performing very good and also get that wide angle camera which is killer 🔥🔥🔥🔥
3. The battery life is good but it would be bettter if they have given the 5000 mAh as on other M series smartphone.
4. Over all the phone is very powerful
5. If you are looking for a stylist branded phone with all the lastest hardware then go for it"
493,9 October 2019,SRB,"Had a lot of expectation after buying this phone. First off the audio of phone calls, it's just terrible! Really bad mic and even in a quiet room, it's a struggle to hear the other person's voice. The volume is insufficient and the sound that comes out has lots of issues.

Next up is the 32mp camera. Huge disappointment as images are not clear and image size does not match up the claim of 32mp. Battery life has been satisfactory. If you are OK with these issues and are ready to fork out more than 20K for this phone, I wish you good luck!"
494,26 July 2019,Vimal J,Camera quality is poor and battery backup is low. Cocktail orange colour is awesome. 3.5 headphone jack is not available. Budget photo with good features. 6gb ram 128 storage capacity. Speed is good and smooth touch screen.
495,12 July 2019,D..,"Dislike : 1. Battery life - should be better considering the current uses of mobile (Audio, video, game, social media, learning apps). Even M30 has 5000 mah battery.
2. Incoming call quality - the unique feature of this model is very disappointing. Not able to hear the voice clearly."
496,21 June 2019,Shagun Aggarwal,"Good phone, 6gb ram is good no lag in daily use, above average battery, but misses a cover and screen guard in box"
497,4 October 2019,Raghu.pulavarth,"Repenting that i have selected one of the worst product ever.Sound system is horrible and the audio jack which come with usb is very loose.Anytime we watch video the audio gets muted automatically and we need to pull out the cable and again keep it and it happens back and forth like that.Also the speaker quality is horrible such that if we receive any calls the audio was so vibrant near the users ear which they claim it as on screen speaker feature for this model.
Not at all happy....Neither able to enjoy with videos nor the audio..."
498,21 September 2019,Praveen Bhatt,"If I use my mobile when it is on a table or bed then touch sensor are not working properly.
Unable to open any app from notification.
Battery is not too good.
Camera is average.
Heating problem is also there.
UI(User Interface) is good but in some applications UI is not perfectly fit on corners of mobile"
499,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Camera quality is ok. But display is LCD not AMOLED Even the cheaper models of Samsung comes with AMOLED Display
Glossy look is not much impressive. Looks like Chinese phone. Available in two colors only. Not much color option.Speed is good"
500,23 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Just discussing some of the cons of the phone -
1. Very poor battery life. Runs for just 12 hours on full charge and moderate usage
2. No 3.5 mm jack, earphones are provided, but becomes a problem if you forget to carry them or if you have to use aux
3. LCD screen. Not best of the display
Rest all is superb"
501,30 July 2019,Kannan k,"I am not suggesting to buy this product. The strong reason was the hearing speaker implementation. They say it is a innovation, but for me it was a pathetic experience. The Voice was coming with vibration because of this technology. It was really annoying to me whenever I received call. Most frequent usage was call only. If that itself irritating then no use of spending that much money to buy this kind of worst product. Another thing is no privacy while speaking with your recipient. Any one can hear the person Voice from any direction."
502,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Sam,Waist of money...... comes with attractive outer design with basic functionality..... compair with M40.... my previous J8 was better... Ctype charger with C type headphones not appreciated pls don't waist your money with outer design
503,3 July 2019,ivishwajeet5,"The Galaxy M40 feels like it's trying to cater to all audiences, and while it is definitely a segment disruptor, it falls a bit short of being the undisputed leader that it could have been. With that said, it's still a solid overall performer, and the most polished M-series offering by Samsung till date.
It has a hole-punch display and Screen Sound tech for voice calls
Apps runs smoothly, battery life is good, but the cameras are average. But you can’t expect everything in this price range. Keep it up, Samsung. Keep Going!"
504,25 July 2019,Tarun,This mobile is one of the worst product I have ever purchased within a month it's speaker is not working properly. I went to the customer service center they told me take backup of data we have to format it. How could expect that just now you have purchased one mobile you have collected most important data now once again you to restore it one time. So inspite of repairing my mobile now I am looking for exchanging this one. What is the use of this mobile if it can not perform properly even for 2 month and you have to visit to the service center. Very worst product this is please don't buy...
505,30 September 2019,Subhash Paul,"Firstly, the design of the phone is great.I really like the punch hole design and the back panel looks good too. Secondly,the cameras are decent, captures good photos , have good dynamic range but software optimization is not that great. Coming to the performance of the phone, the phone can easily handle heavy games and applications, and does not have any heating issues. Lastly, the battery life ain't bad and easily last me a full day but it might be less for a Heavy user.

Overall, the phone is good for this price range."
506,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Sound quality is very bad,I was using samsung J7 maxx and had high hopes with this phone but feel disappointed."
507,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Rishi bhatt,Not good call voice.vibrating
508,28 June 2019,Rajkumar Jain,"Overall Phone is good but its battery and camera is not as good as other mobile brands in this range. Battery is drainig very fast, automatic brightness is working very slowly and front camera quality is also not good and there is also some bugs in proximity sensor. Its request to samsung that please fix all these issues as soon as possible. Mobile is all good, can be purchase by believing on samsung, that they will fix all these issues in its further updates. These are all that i know about the phone after using it for 7 days."
509,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Chintan Bodar,Not up to the mark. Call voice clarity is too bad I am not able to hear it properly on the call when I am out of office or home. Now amazon does not have refund policy please place your order accordingly.
510,6 September 2019,Sash,"It is the worst phone i have even seen in my life..
1. the speaker dosen't work always.. need t I'll restart the phone to make it work.
2. Not able to hear an ur sound after using the headphone.
3. Bettery life is not good.
4. Phone gets hanged frequently showing the message ""UI not responding""

#amazonindia metioned there was a return policy but when i called them and informed them about the problem, they said they won't replace the phone. I requested them few times but nothing happened."
511,27 June 2019,Sandeep P.,"Best phone , best in class , best for photography, the processor is awesome it can handle all heavy games , dolby atmos increases the quality of music or movie , moreover it also has widevine l1 certification for streaming movies and shows from amazon prime or Netflix at fhd quality moreover punch hole display makes it look more premium , Only one bad thing is that battery is only 3100 mah but device lasts for 7-8 hours"
512,4 October 2019,Amazon Customer,"Using the mobile since last 4 months. Mobile speaker on phone quality is not good at all. Unable to hear caller voice clearly. Camera is not up to the mark. It's just average, I can not say good and was not expected this type of camera quality from Samsung. Slow motion and super slomotion mode is completely useless. you can record only 3-4 sec. only in this mode. Body is made of good quality plastic. Screen would be gorilla glass but it's not."
513,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Dhirendra harish,"The waste phone .. audio.. too much eco not comfort and voice problem. Camera never like 32 mp...
I never suggest purchase this waste phone.. and even dont purchase from AMAZON"
514,24 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Totally unhappy with the battery life though it survives the entire day without much scare but heavy users need to stay away from this phone.
The sound during calls is not at all clear and quite uncomfortable probably due to on-screen sound feature
Doesn't have a notification led nor samsung pay.
Also the 3.5mm headphone jack is missing and so is the connector.
Many features missing for the price
M30 or a50 can be a better choice tahn this."
515,20 July 2019,Sumit Kabdal,"This is very good phone. I did not find any big difference in its display though it has TFT screen. Camera quality is good. Touch is smooth and crisp.
The only concern is for battery life. Samsung needs to work on it a bit more. I will give 4 star 🌟 out of

After using it for around 3 weeks. The battery thing is irritating me more n more. Even if you don't use it much the battery drain like anything. I would have not buy this phone if I had any clue about its battery performance."
516,11 August 2019,Kavita,"Great device. You get a premium looking handset which is very handy and light at the same time. 6GB Ram and 128 GB space is cool. You get only 3 color options. Blue is my personal favourite.
I have been using this device for more than a week now and quite happy with it.
It would be a five star for M40 if it had a better battery life. Overall good."
517,The manufacturer commented on the review below,vijay chandra pandey,"If u want a good camera, good network reception and a good battery life, pls don't waste ur money. The camera is pathetic when compares to galaxy a50, nokia 8.1 and even 7+. the facial recognition fails on several occassions. The hard part is cudn't return it back to amazon as the app they ask to intall shows everything ok!!!"
518,24 June 2019,Ashish Paliwal,"Poor call voice quality due to in screen earpiece tech, fingerprint unlock is slow, battery life and charging hours too sub par, it takes a lot of time to charge, does not feel like fast charge, missing 3.5 mm jack also creates problems, no Amoled screen"
519,The manufacturer commented on the review below,pema kunga,For one fall above knees height my screen is broken. How much it cost to change the screen?
520,28 June 2019,Aditya,"Overall performance is nice but only the problem is with the touch sensitivity because screen responds when it touches with earphone wire , clothes etc. I recommend at least they should provide a good quality screen guard in the box as well. And while calling it sounds like call has connected and you can here ringing sound but that's not a actual call and i need to disconnect it and call again. but that is Rest everything is perfectly fine. I hope I will get supported app like G cam , samsung pay and other app soon."
521,24 June 2019,LIJO RAJAN,"The phone looks good, and the performance wise average. It is light weight and easy to handle. Especially sound clarity with Dolby Atmos is just amazing, feels like sitting in theater. Camera is not much good, the clarity is poor. Fast charging .. but, it draining as like fast charging. Bio metric finger lock is working fast as compared to face recognition lock. While calling sound on screen is good. Overall, look wise it is fabulous, camera is not much good, battery is poor. But, Music with Dolby Atmos is awesome."
522,10 August 2019,yugesh,Smooth and speed with some of the pre-installed Samsung apps. Disabled those after that mobile is very fast. Clarity and design are top notch. Speaker volume is a bit different as it uses the new screen vibrating tech. Takes a while to get used to it.
523,29 June 2019,Shruti Tushar Kokam,"Punch hole display is the best part of Samsung M40 and the most satisfying thing, is the colour contrast and design♡♡♡I'm fully satisfied(^^) this M40 also contends amazing earphones within ..gaming is totally Awesome ♡_speechless further_
And about disliking part of M40 is we all no it contends 3500mh battery life.. it's not enough for heavy use.. but it's not like disliking because Samsung company as solved this problem, using fast charger it's always better with fast charger"
524,23 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Superb phone and value for money..
Pros
1. Superb design
2. Display Quality
3. Camera
4. Fast Charger
5. Cool performance with out any lag

Cons
1. OST is good but volume is some what low when taking calls
2. Charger wire length
3. Expected AMOLED

Overall rating. . Excellent and met the expectations. .

Thank U Samsung. ."
525,28 July 2019,Atul verma,"Buttery MAH to be improved, front camera quality noy good as My last experiance Glaxy J5. Display should not be compromise as all series. If you have given 32 MP camera the you shoul provide Super amoled display.

If Battery and Display should be improved quality wise then this phone will be Good one. As my last experience was really amazing and fully satisfied with galaxy J5 but i have purchased M40 but we have found some problems 1- Display quality, 2- Battery, Front flash with front camera quality."
526,29 July 2019,Vipin Saini,"I was brought this phone in 15 July 2019.
After using 2 or 3 day's we realized that could purchase wrong phone.
M40 raking not so good compare with m30.
Voice call in open area can't listen clearly.
Camera megapixels are 32 but can not equal to 12 or 16 megapixel.
Night vision technology are also not for valuable.
Screen voice technology are also failed with voice call.
Front camera clicking on bad pictures."
527,24 June 2019,Col Sharad Srivastava,"Been using the phone for 3 days now and this is the basic idea I have about it.
1. Camera with Gcam does wonders.
2. Really smooth and the 6GB RAM with SD675 ensure a smooth experience.
3. It takes time getting used to sound on screen technology, though it could be better.
4. The speakers sound nice.
5. Battery life is as expected and with moderate use, it lasts a day.
OVERALL I'D SUGGEST THIS PHONE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT PERFORMANCE WITH A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY"
528,17 July 2019,Aparna,"Excellent gadget to own. Amazingly quick delivery next morning after placing the order. Great looks, clear sound quality.
One problem though, the charging chord fit into the instrument is loose. Unless you carefully check repeatedly the fast charging may not happen at all."
529,23 June 2019,Bharat,"Awesome smartphone from Samsung loved it ...paisa vasul h bhai...
This was my first day review...after using it for 10 days I loved this phone alot no battery prblm no heating prblm overall phone is best at this price..."
530,28 June 2019,Vishal,"Using this phone since last one week. Good handset with variety of features. Though battery is 3500 MAH, but good backup as of now. Camera quality and speaker volume is good.
Cons: There is just one Type-C USB, for charging as well as for earphones. No Wireless charging."
531,The manufacturer commented on the review below,kathan majethia,worst pictures
532,The manufacturer commented on the review below,G Kandhasamy,USB connector and disconnected notification coming without connecting usb in port....then phone gets locked when power button is pressed but screen remains in ON conditions...
533,2 August 2019,namit jain,Built quality is good so is the camera and the fingerprint scanner but the thing that bothered me the most is the placement of the speaker grill for calls which instead of the top corner is located way far from the centre near the right top corner. Now I do not know that is it the placement of those or something else but WHENEVER YOU TALK TO SOMEONE THE SOUND ECHOS MAKING A COMPLETE MOCKERY OF THE PHONE. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A HEAVY CALLING PERSON!!!!!!!!
534,6 August 2019,vishal,The phone is worth of money.. all the features are great except for the battery life.. full charge will stay all day if u use it seldom only for calls... video use only 6 hours if used continuously.. its been one and half months and the phone has started lagging occasionally.. not disappointed yet not extremely happy eith the device.. 3.5/5 for value for money..
535,The manufacturer commented on the review below,wish,Do not buy it unless you willing to Charge this mobile 3 times a day. Due to not OMG BATTERY I've to charge this mobile 3 times a day. My usage is average and same as my last mobile. Camera is also average and not up to the mark as compared other same segment phones. Bigggg issue is battery though.
536,12 August 2019,Amazon Customer,If you want to have a feel of a branded phone in budget then u can go for it since the punch hole camera leaves people guessing that it is high end flagship phone. The other qualities are so so. The screen is tft so dont expect a great viewing experience although u will not be able to say whether it is tft or not until u compare the viewing experience with other smartphones which have amoled screens. If u like the design then go for it ptherwise nothing very special about it
537,1 August 2019,Navnath,Finger print is not quick enough..camera quality is not upto the mark and battery drains very fast doesn't last longs for more then 12 hours a day...overall i won't recommend to buy this this phone..my money is wasted please don't waste 20k to buy this worst piece...
538,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Aniket Nayak,"Camera is bad for this price range and this new screen sound technology is shit it vibrates Ur phone and heats it up
If for some reason u are not concern with with camera and calling quality then this phone is a beast but what use will be a mobile phone if u can't even call adequately with it"
539,28 June 2019,Rakshit Joshi,"Awesome smartphone!
Yeah really I mean this phone was just next to perfect for me. In this range I got everything including 6GB RAM 128GB ROM. talking about camera, was cool again. But again one thing which I believe Samsung could have improved on might be battery as in this range you always expect better,right?
Anyways, type c charging fixes the issue though. And yeah who can forget type c earphones with Dolby Atmos!!
Overall the phone is worth the price."
540,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Honey,Waste of money......
541,28 August 2019,RUSHABH JAIN,The built in main front speaker is very bad. Phone get heat up whn i use it for long time. I want to return this phone and amazon is not taking this back. As a true amazon customer i always use to buy every product from amazon only and in my whole history the first time i want to give this product back and amazon is not ready for taking this material back. Disappointed with the service. I m trying to return thiss product back for last 4 dayz and i m not getting any positive rply from amazon side.
542,13 October 2019,Amazon Customer,"This is my 4th Samsung mobile. The Worst Model Ever Purchased.. Even for returning or replacing, faced lot of difficulties.. Worthless.. Amazon Customer Support for returning it is very bad.. They hav to improve.. Still i m getting shaky Images with this mbl camera.. wide angle camera and all totally waste.. Better go for some below 10k mbl of other brands which is equivalent to this model.... Very Very Worst Experiance with Amazon and Samsung.."
543,25 June 2019,Pratik,"The reason I like this phone & I bought this phone 1st day of launching is Samsung with such features & with this Price its realy OMG Moment for us , awesome design Display resolution is so clear & Bright with very unique Punch hole Diplay, Color of back panel sea water with two tone is also very eye catcher, with Tripple camera & 6 GB + 128 This time Samsung big hearted for ther User . Processor also good u can play games with good graphics. Worth buying this Phone ."
544,23 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Pros:
Superb camera even in dim light
Display quality is wow
Response is damn good
Easy to hold and nice looking phone
Heating is comparatively less

Cons
Battery time is low for heavy usage
One UI has tons of bugs for every day use
You need couple of calls before you adjust to in screen speaker"
545,22 September 2019,k k.,"Strong battery with longer life is one of the main reasons that I bought this mobile. Unfortunately, it barely lasts for 2 days though I use the phone for not more than 2 hours per day. The number of apps I use is also minimum. I am grossly disappointed with the battery."
546,29 June 2019,Pratibha Marothi,"i liked the overall product , nice phone with samsung branding
except i will recommend uh to buy a back case as i got scraches the first day that too just keeping it in pocket
earphones are average, the battery seems to run a whole day but i dont know if that is gonna be good in long run
otherwise great display and other features are just awesome
sound quality for call is just great"
547,29 September 2019,guru12,This phone I have received with high expectations but it has disappointed me to the extreme . New phone Hangs frequently within 1 week of app installation and the return and exchange policy for amazon is very bad in this case . It would take some time to get the phone ready for use and understand all the features so 10 days is very less . I am not at all satisfied with this product . I need my money back if amazon values its prime customers .
548,24 June 2019,Spectarine,The phone works well. I had some issues with getting the sim tray to open. the one complaint about the product is that the call volume is pretty low and the camera quality is not as promised.
549,29 July 2019,Ranjana Srivastava,It has been a month that i purchase this phone and it hangs so so much that you cant even open it or do anything for a 4 to 5 mins. It has such a worst speaker. You can't hear anything properly. Speaker vibrates so much when the other person speaks. Screen gets automatically locked when a call is received i again have to enter the paswrds and open it. Worst performance. I regret buying it. Even after the complain the amazon was not hear for the exchange of product. Do not buy this please.
550,24 June 2019,Abhijit Paul,"Phone is Perfectly Handy.. you can not feel it until you hold it in your hand.. Display is really really great although it dose not have amoled display but its quite Good and Very smooth and colourfull display.. Overall Awesome handset.. Camera, Battery Performance is Avarage. Built quality, Design, perfect..
Great Entry of M series.."
551,2 August 2019,Amazon Customer,"Camera is not very good, specially the front camera. Although you get wide angle for the rear camera, it is not up to the mark. Fingerprint is very slow. Battery is kind of okay. Otherwise a great package. In this price range with the brand of Samsung, you simply can't get wrong."
552,28 June 2019,Thirunavukarasu,Overall Performance is good. Doesn't hang no lag because of 6GB RAM. Does not heat much. Less weight mobile. Simply superb performance . But camera quality is not up to the mark. It doesn't look like a 32MP quality camera it is more equal to 16MP camera only. But the wide angle feature is too good. It covers an entire room. The front camera is mentioned as 16MP camera but it is also not upto mark. Battery could have been better. Still 3500mAh battery is upto mark. Over All rating 4
553,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Customer V,Voice quality is absolutely poor. You can feel the vibrations in the earpiece while speaking. Submitted complaint but and was told that product will be replaced. Yet to hear from someone for return pick up.
554,5 July 2019,Pratham singh,"It's a good phone looks and feel modern
Fingerprint sensor works accurately,
Camera is quite good in sunlight
But doesn't works as expected in low light
The only main problem I find in the phone is its battery
It consist of chip 675 so I thought battery management would be good, that it would last long but still wasn't able to keep up with my hope
Sound screen technology works quite okayish Though I have to say the phone at this price point in amazing"
555,4 August 2019,PRATAP KUMAR BISWAL,"Waste money, dear please don't buy m40 because front camera very poor, potret mode not available, fingerprint not fast,battery backup half day, screen quality very bad. Actually price maximum below 10000 for this mobile require, 19900 is very high for this mobile."
556,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ipsita,Its barely audible when someone speaks from the other side... Cmon that is the basic need of a phone.... I wanna return this phone not just replace it
557,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Screen touch and resolution very good. Camera quality and flash super, even in low light nice pics. Performance good.
Back body is made up of plastic look wise appear premium but after 5 days only scratches are appearing in margins of the phone. No blink light for notification very disappointing.... Screen speaker concept is good but the received sound quality is not very fine and original. Battery life is so so just average. Face detection and finger print work nicely..."
558,21 August 2019,Alok Dixit,"I purchased m40 one and half months ago. From beginning it is not working properly.Some issues are like heating, Battery back not good, Screen is LCD, not good as compare to Amoled, and one feature screen sound is the worst feature as I feel. Right now my mobile is in service centre because earphones are not working. So I can say Samsung fully looted with this product. Please don't buy this product. Thank you."
559,The manufacturer commented on the review below,vikrant,Phone is ok. Not so great..got it replaced view handset not charging.. but great customer support by Amazon team..Amazon lived upto its reputation..not happy with product...but glad with Amazon customer support...Faith on online shopping has been made more stronger by Amazon Team..kudoos to backend team
560,11 July 2019,sudesh,"Phone is not responding correctly when using headset and when scroll newsfeed it is not at all responding apart from this the front cam is just like when you take a pic with a china phone never ever think about this phone Samsung had just created a waste phone expected much but none come what I expected not cam, not battery, not headset, screen operating and also the brightness is auto adjusting though keep the auto brightness off... wtf???"
561,28 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"This is my first Samsung phone. Worth for money. I liked screen and phone is light weight. I bought sea water blue one and everyone liked that color very much. Video and sound quality is good. I faced some issues in call which was like some disturbance at sometime.You will get pattern, fingerprint and face recognition to unlock. Battery life as well is good. I didn't feel like draining. No heating effect as such. Overall good product for the amount."
562,27 June 2019,Ameya Ranade,"The specifications of the phone are amazing in terms of the speed of the processor, the fast charging and the overall design of the phone. However, the camera does have a slight lag while capturing images in low light thereby causing slight blurring of the images. However, for day light photography, it is amazing. The battery should have been atleast 4000 mAh as the battery gets drained within 8 hours of normal usage. However, it is compensated by the fast charging feature."
563,26 August 2019,Balaji,"The battery doesn't charge fast if the mobile is connected to wifi or if the mobile data is turned on.
The mobile hangs if you play premium games, the camera is worst and doesn't capture a good picture,while clicking the picture it ll focus chages and the picture is blurry, even if you hold the mobile in the gimbal. Not worth for the money. Instead of purchasing this mobile,you can go for Nokia on the same segment as they have better processor."
564,24 June 2019,im@rajaram,"Blindly go for it guys. Best quality in every aspects. And dont search for speed and performance reviews. We already know its Snapdragon 675.

Anyways thanks Amazon for delivering my product safely. 👏"
565,22 July 2019,DRK,I ordered for my friends sister...It's a very good mobile at this price range... especially it's opt for women's...Worth for this price range than anyother Chinese mobiles...Don't waste money in Chinese mobiles...
566,28 June 2019,vishal gaurav,Everything is very good. One of the best phone in 20k range. Though battery life could have been better and some of the default android pie behavior is missing liye log press volume key to change music track. Sometimes when a call comes the phone screen doesn't turn on and I have to manually unlock the screen and receive the call from notifications. Apart from these it's very good. Look and build is premium. Display is awsome.
567,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Nambi Rajan S,"Got this phone on first day sale out with lot of expectation..
Worst speaker technology voice was not clear, heating up so fast, for continously using battery will not support..
Poor camera quality..
Sometimes screen touch not functioning, finger print at back side is average..
Pros: slim look, core processor speed as a new phone..
Cons:
Many
Camera, speaker, head phone, compatibility.. Etc
Think twice before going to this phone.."
568,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Rahul,"This is worst product from Samsung. I have lose the trust value by purchasing this phone.

I am facing hanging issue and this device doesn't perform well neither the camera nor fingerprint and touch of this phone.

Plz don't purchase this device this is just a waste of money"
569,13 August 2019,Ethan,"Was confused between A50 and M40. But not disappointed anymore.
One thing, I was to clarify that the voice quality is absolutely fine. While making first few calls, they exactly tells where to put ear to hear the sound (which many people might have ignored). So you need to put your ear on the contact's photo, which appears on dialling screen.

Camera quality is not ""that"" much good. But I guess, it will be improved with updates, as is the case with A50."
570,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Right now I have some query about my recent order , as per Samsung M 40 ,
the mobile come along with 15v fast charger but when I checked with charger
details it's shows only 5v. Today I check with Samsung till free no
regarding this and my handset also get hot when this is only 2 days old.

I will give full review and update once corrdinate with Samsung till free
no or local authrise dealer."
571,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"samsung has nailed it after so long years...
1. screen is awsome guess the best in this segment.
2. touch is really very sensitive.
3. camera is good but guys pls don't compare it with one+...as one+ is way ahead but the camera quality in this segment is the best.
demerit:
battery life is ok not great one...n the fast charging is not as fast as that of one + samsung could work on the fast charging n battery backup.."
572,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Was expecting something as per said in advertisement.
Camera quality is worst in ever my life.
Seems it's not from Samsung... Samsung disappointed me... As I'm samsung phone user since I'm using mobiles.

Worst camera ever. If anyone going for camera... Just do not buy it.

Now even battery started draining.... 3 to 5 hrs r enough in ideal condition to discharge totally"
573,15 July 2019,SK,"Pros:
Memory and performance
Good Camers Quality
Infinity display
Fast Charging
Nice color combination

Cons:
At this price battery life is very poor. Battery drain in 6 hrs with active internet.
Sometimes you are unable to hear voice during calls"
574,22 July 2019,Deepak Mehta,"Problem is that Samsung should let know the users about the detailed features of the phone such as Smart Switch, Samsung Music and Secure Folders feature which was not available in the phone."
575,28 August 2019,Amazon Customer,"After using for 2 months
Likes:-
1)Looks are good
2)Display Quality is Good
Dislikes:-
1) Headphones stopped working
2)Fast charging is not working after 2 months of usage.
3) Camera is worst my old phone's single camera was better than the triple camera setup
4)Showing sim not detected need to restart phone again and again

And Samsung's after sales service is terrible .
Don't buy go for some other brand."
576,16 July 2019,Amazon Customer,phones are to communicate and this phone makes listening to voice difficult. I struggle every time I receive a call. Phone has speaker under the screen and not at the top. Everytime I need to adjust my ear up and down to find the right locatiion of speaker. I wanted to return it on the last day but I had only 30 mins to decide for replacement. There was no option to return it without exchange so unfortunately I am still using this phone.
577,21 June 2019,Kaliraja,"After using 10 days...my honest opinion...
1.camera is very good when using g cam..
2.Display and design looks nice
3.heating when heavy use..but its ok..
4.performence very good and smooth
5.very disappointed with battery and fast charging... full charge with in 1.45 hrs
6.earphones and audio quality is fantastic..
Type c Samsung earphone works very superb..
Over-all:3.5/5....if it comes under 18k it will be the ruler..."
578,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Shivam Singh,"Worst Phone Ever
0 in performance not for gaming
Heating issues"
579,18 August 2019,Brenfil,"Love the phone really cute piece got the cocktail orange colour which is wonderful
Battery runs for a day for me but that's good for me fast charging too
Hybrid SIM slot (either 2 Sims or 1 SIM with memory card) 6gb with 128 GB storage
For me a great product"
580,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Aftab,"I purchased M40 mobile for my mother but
I received defective products.
Sim tray is not working.
Still she has no mobile for communication
Amazon customer care is telling. They will provide another mobile after checking.
For this process it will take time.😡🤬🤬"
581,2 July 2019,G-ONE,"Good product but the Return policy is not good in amazon. As if we're asking for return then they are not allowed to return they are trying to diagnose instead of taking the return and refund request.
It was very bad experience. At last I have kept it for sales after 6 days of purchase for 14000 in other site . 5000 lose. Overall phone is good, except the heating issue while using hotspot. It is good for all the muti tasking and high usage of gaming."
582,3 July 2019,Patel,"Quality wise good product. A new feature ""Voice in Screen"" is good but little bit humming the full phone during call. The worst thing is it becomes hot early in a few work only.
Battery and other some features can be increased by Samsung, but compare to this segment, it's not as worth. But there is a brand name. So not bad even. Overall good midrange product.
Samsung has to solve earlier hitting issue and humming issue too."
583,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Santosh,"Very worst mobile.Following are the reasons for telling this product is worst:
1.Charging will get over easily even we don't use mobile that.
2.Over heating while mobile in charging,call or surfing internet
3.Volume buttons will work automatically while using mobile.
4.Without hands free nothing was audible for watching a video
5.speakers are not working properly over call
Looking wose only mobile is good, features are worst"
584,26 June 2019,prakhar,"Battery drains out in around 48hours .. on normal usage, without any heavy game usage such as pubg.
Ram at any instance is free around 2 gb, even when you have closed all running apps, and restarted device. We get around 100gb free out of 128.

Biometrics work good.

Face detection works even when helmet is put on. Fingerprint sensors work good.

Ambient sensors are very adaptive.

Very smooth device. Camera is just loveable."
585,19 July 2019,Ravi Shankar,"I will not recommend to purchase this phone.
- Interms of camera only MP and numer of camera is increased and photo quality is noy good.
- Gusters are not attractive even you can't take screen shot using guster still using old way (power+vol down)
- Auto screen off doesn't works during the call when you put the phone on the ear.
Really it shows samsung cheapness."
586,17 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Not worth for this price range.
Poor camera at this budget.
Battery life is very poor.
Phone is over heating.
No notification light.
Display and britness is avareage.
Very low call quality..
Speaker is not that much loud . Even you can't hear calls at crowdy place.
Only 3.5 jack is supported in the mobile (Big minus)."
587,30 September 2019,krishna,"I have booked this phone for camera mainly, but very much disappointed with camera. Photos are not having more than 1mb size, not clear images, camera mode images are of very dull. Night time photos are very dull when compared to daytime.

589,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Akhilendra Gadde,"Camera is very disappointing. Gcam does okayish but stock is just horrible.
Looks are good, but phone heats up quickly.
Software isn't that great, kinda annoying to use.

No headphone jack. Didn't like it"
590,11 September 2019,Kiran kadwe,....its my 4th smartphone Please do not buy this product.....Worst product I have returned this device within 24 hrs ....main problem of this device is it doesn't detect network and data and cant listen clear voice during voice calls .....Do not buy.
591,8 October 2019,Ronit,"How this product produced under Samsung branding.
Worst ever battery life and charging capability with brand provided Cable and Charging socket.
Product is not way below expectations and specifications."
592,29 June 2019,RANJAN R. ABHISHEK,"Sub Rs 20k Category Killer phone by Samsung. Lots of pluses like good battery life, amazing display, gigantic space. Very few cons i found was higher placing of fingerprint scanner and battery of 3500. A very modern and very cool phone to have"
593,The manufacturer commented on the review below,devi kj,Many times it is not recognising SIM card suddenly showing SIM card error. Not sure it’s a common problem for this phone to everyone. Thinking to return!!!
594,25 July 2019,Sreekanth KL,I bought this phone just a day back. Phone looks wise it is very good but looks like samsung forgot about the primary feature of a mobile . During the calls phone vibrates and and I am unable to hear the voice from other side . It is realy disgusting. Amazon is also NOT allowing to return this product . 20K is waste of money . I didnt see any reason to use this phone with out basic feature of the phone.
595,11 July 2019,Viral J,"The incoming call speaker cracks & half of the mobile phone vibrates while we speak with the other person. Amazon says that their technician has reported the mobile is working perfectly rather than I showing them the live demo of sound cracking & half the mobile vibrating while on call. Furthermore, this technicians talked with us with Rajnigandha/Manikchand in their mouth...They are not professionals."
596,21 June 2019,Anil,"Overall great , but I'm little bit unhappy with the camera as compare with honor 8x. Also lacking the phone."
597,18 August 2019,Shilpi Gupta,The phone does not have a notification light which indicates a pending message or missed call. My previous handset also from Samsung had the notification feature. Also face recognition for starting the phone is very erratic. It says 'no match' on a number of occasions. I feel these features are basic to a handset before packing it with technical stuff.
598,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Look and feel is good.
Camera- both front and backside Camera quality is very bad.
Sound: Screen sound technology is not good, you won’t be able to hear the real voice.
Battery life: average
not worth more than 10K"
599,22 July 2019,d v kiran kumar,"Interface not satisfactory. Major drawback is u cannot hide your personal photos in gallery. Battery life is very poor. One cannot use internet all day. Battery dries off very fast within five hours. Without internet too, battery doesnt last the day."
600,26 September 2019,chandra Reddy,"I bought this mobile 2 months ago..
Performance is ok for few days.
Last 10 daye Unable to hear clear voice for attending calls ..

Not worth mobile for 20000/"
601,8 August 2019,Ankit Parashar,Camera Quality & overall features...well this phone is truly amazing in overall performance..specifically design. Run very well without any issue at all.. inbuilt memory 128gb with 6gb ram make this phone A champion . Camera is very decent u find clear pic. Battery easily last long a day . It's really A premium phone from Samsung..just go for it.
602,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Front camera is wrost ....its like 5 mp output..No detail in feont camera..
Its just wrost..

And Face unlock is not working maximum time and its very slow..if u close your eyes then unlock ur screen..and one important things .I set my face on face unlock features but its unlock by my friend's face....Dont buy guys...its no value for money product...Please wait for Redmi k20 at just 20000"
603,9 September 2019,Baiju vk,"Good phone, but the camera quality is not so good as compared to my OnePlus 5. Display is good, punch hole camera looks nice. Also, it has to be handled with care as it is too fragile."
604,29 June 2019,Basant,Phone is awesome in look. It feels great to lift in hand and use. It has a premium finish. Fingerprint is very good but face unlock takes time. Camera quality is also very good but sometimes a little noise is there in selfies and after 3-4 days of use i am feeling that battery is draining fast and also battery is taking about 2 hours to get full charged. Overall the phone is best according to me if battery problem is solved by update.
605,7 August 2019,Sai Bonthala,"Overall, phone with a nice feel and good looks. Beware of sound reception, this phone lacks earpiece and a new sound technology has been placed which very reduces clarity of sound. Avoid if possible!"

608,24 June 2019,Souvik Kundu,"Samsung M40 makes me happy by its stunning looks.. The procesor is realy very fast & reponse is very good. Though battery is running down very quickly for its high storage & memory... but its okay that its really take 120 min only to 100%.. the rear camera is at its highest point at this budge compared with any other phone, but shelfie camera littlebit disappoint me.. value for money product.. Thank you samsung & thank you amazon"
609,24 July 2019,Zuber Ahmed,"Got at 12.05k in prime sale and replace included. Only reason to buy is less amount. Performance is nice. Rich look, good features, camera not uptown the mark. Handy phone for office guy."
610,3 July 2019,Saurabh kuradkar,"Fingerprint is fast and accurate,.....
Back camera is sharp,,, slow mo and super slow mo features are excellent .....little bit issues with the front camera during night .......it beautify extremely I have tried different modes but fails to give natural looks.....during daytime works better......battery life is a bit less for such a smart phone but there is no problem u have a fast charger which takes about 30 min to charge 60%"
611,17 August 2019,Ashwin,"Good battery life
Decent camera
Excellent display
Good ram management

Speaker sound quality can be better.
No headfone jack, comes with type C headfones"
612,20 July 2019,S S Biradar,"OMG, its a master piece in just 19k. Finally Samsung will regain its lost glory in under 20k club. Its real gem and if you want a top quality phone under 20k then it will never let you down."
613,28 June 2019,Nilesh Rawal,"Battery life is below the normal.
Otherwise it is okay. The phone gets heated when used for a long time ."
614,22 July 2019,Harisankar prusty,"Mobile is having on screen speker because of that echo is happening at the time of call and sometimes it's vibrating.camera also not up to mark as the pics taken by the mobile when you zoom it will look like broken.you will find problem with audio jack if you are not using the earphone given by Samsung.
If you are photographer and want to try some affects like bokeh then the pics doesn't not look good."
615,27 June 2019,Manish Thakkar,"Samsung Galaxy M40 Disliked : handset used 1 week, 3500 mAh Battery life is week & doesn't stay for full day manufacturer should improve battery more then 5000 mAh, handset heating for continues use, why manufacturer not given cast screen option to connect smart television?"
616,20 August 2019,Gurpreet singh,"Worse phone ever... screen looks system is poor.. earphone are worst , duplicate earphones can work better have long life then its original earphones. Its been 2 months only and my earphones are not working now . I buy this mobile on 19 june 2019 mobile is getting many problems in it. It has sound problem as well , being on call other person cannot hear me properly.. i will suggest not to buy this phone ever .. money waste"
617,9 August 2019,M. G.,"Nice looking phone
Some problems are there
- flickering slow motion videos.
- right/left sliding while charging is not smooth.
- only works with Indian SIM cards.
- short charging cable.
- dose not support Samsung Pay.
- fingerprint is ok but not as good as the galaxy S series.
- battery doesn't lasts one day with my regular use."
618,26 June 2019,Janardan Dubey,Rear camera camera is poor quality . sound is very low and worst quality . i sam purchasing through amazon . it is delivered very WROST MOBLILE M 40 samsung .
619,17 August 2019,Adeeth Joshii,"This has been a good purchase. Bought it via exchange offer here, and I must say it's complete VFM. Don't think twice, go ahead and buy this piece. Don't forget to buy a sturdy phone cover as well!"
620,29 June 2019,Aman Singh,"There's nothing in the name of fast charging, instead this charges even slow than the other phones in the market, yeah but it has fast battery draining feature."
621,2 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Front camera is ordinary one. The main drawback is the screen sound technology. When on call ,it is very difficult to listen with the highest call volume. Moreover, voice clarity is an issue. It's very difficult to listen to other person on call. Now I am using headphon to call someone. I strongly recommend others not to purchase this product unless the technical team resolve the issue"
622,25 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Good phone with smoother performance, great screen, good innovation of screen voice without earpiece, clear voice.... I would recommend this phone to buy. It would be great experience and u won't regret after purchasing it... camera is also good with decent pictures, surprisingly performs fine even in low light, however there is no night mode given there, even there are good results in night pictures..."
623,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Chukka abhilash,This is the condition of the Sim tray when I opened it . Very delicate piece. Amazon customer service is also very irresponsible. How can the mobile damage within one week. Even Samsung store is demanding 10k for the repair. What's the point in buying the mobile phone for 20k. Neither Amazon nor Samsung is responding correctly. It is mentioned there is warranty for 6 months. Where should the customer claim the warranty😠😠
624,12 August 2019,Sachin Khatry,"Yeah its a good phone with a big screen which i m not use to
3 cameras click best shot ...
has awesome looks no doubt and
Battery life may be low on specs but very good in usage (depending on the usage ; because i use the device very less)
Speaker is not very loud but ok ok kind i can say
Call quality is good (not need to say)"
625,The manufacturer commented on the review below,BINU C KURIAN,"Phone having heating while speaking.
Audio sound while speaking is bad."
626,30 June 2019,Manisha Prasad,"The model of the phone is really fancy. I love the camera of the phone and super slow - mo and Live focus are my favorite features of the camera. The positioning of the front camera is quite different but NOT weird at all, you get the infinite display and the black pinhole circle is pretty negligible. I think the Battery life could be improved a bit. But overall the phone is real good and a must buy."
627,29 June 2019,Ramesh Raman,"The phone and itz specs are worth for the money. Rear cam is good and the features are good.
I didn't like the type c Jack for both charger and headset since while putting headset it is consuming charge and we can't use both at a time. Front cam is more of artificial colors. Phone is heated when talking for more time. Charging is slow with the phone charger. When charged through my c7 pro charger it is charging fast."
628,25 June 2019,Banti Kumar,I bought Samsung M40 in 19990 ..it's price is too high as compare to phone. It's camera quality is good and battery performance is fine but not going long lasting with heavy game play and pubg is not running well ..when I am playing pubg.this is lacking so much ..so guys if you're pubg player so don't buy this phone ..if you're camera lover then you can go with it ..
629,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Madhu babu duvvapu,This is the worst product I buy in my life very worst the battery was fully unsatisfied and the mobile performance was too bad in the speaker it is vibrating lot of times on the call and the song in the gaming was too dull and also the phone was heated a lot in gaming and videos I ask this for the customer support they said this mobile was not designed for games only calls this is the worst experience to buy this mobile
630,22 July 2019,Amit Singh Dalal,"Camera and battery are below average except rear camera.
Fingerprint reader of samsung isnt good.
Display can be better in 10 thousand phone
On screen calling facility is disguisting."
631,19 August 2019,ravi singh RAJPOOT,Its just an average Quality of Mobile..Looking nice due to Cocktail Orange Colour .But nothing extra or special in this phone. This review is giving after 1 month using the phone..Battery life is very Bad..Camera is good...
632,24 August 2019,akshay k.,"The phone is good in looks.battery lasts whole day, but will take a little longer to charge.
One thing I am not happy about is the sound quality..during calls it is ok, but when listening to music ,sometimes in the middle there is an abrupt drop/change in quality noticeably..don't know it's just in my phone or is in common..but will sure like to address it."
633,The manufacturer commented on the review below,BINDU NATH JHA,"Delivered on time by Amazon
But back camera quality is poorest i have ever seen. Not even matching the quality of 5MP camera. Zooming quality is always poor.
Suggest everyone to never buy Samsung phones under Rs 40K.
Now i have to wait for few years to buy good phone having quality cameras.
Samsung should stop attaching cameras to phones under 20k specially.
Even Rajiv Makhini's view also NOT true about cameras quality."
634,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Arunkumar,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. OTHER BRANDS HEADSET IS NOT WORKING. TYPE C TO 3.5 CONVERTER IS NOT WORKING. I AM RAISED COMPLAINT AMAZON AND SAMSUNG. THEY ARE NOT GIVE PROPER INFORMATION WHY IT IS NOT WORKING. DON'T BUY CHOSE OTHER BRAND. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY
635,25 June 2019,srinivasan,The mobile is handy and good . But the cameras are not as expected in portrait mode and front facing camera. The battery is meant ok. Not enthralled but satisfied with the M40 as it has snap 675 and others software features compared to A50 and other mobile and it would be better of Samsung would have gone for AMOLED. Almost no others flaws but samsung flunked to give AMOLED and better camera quality and battery.
636,19 July 2019,pankaj g.,"I was looking for 6Gb+128Gb mobile under 15000. There were few options. MI phone was equally good but I have chosen this because of less SAR value.
Pros:
1. sleek design
2. camera quality is food

cons:
1. It is not having universal charger.
2. At a time you can charge or use headphones.
Overall good mobile"
637,3 July 2019,Pravin Cheulwar,"I booked this phone on first day without waiting for reviews becaz of successful M series but it was my wrong decision.
- Flickering screen while watching videos, touch is good
- call quality is very poor barely audible from other side
- Charging wire length is very short
- Camera photo quality is not upto the mark, need improvement on edges (sharpness).
- Sound is ok
- Premium look"
638,30 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"I've been using this phone over a month it is very fast does not hang even a bit, can play pubg in hd and ultra fps, Great camera. awesome.... super slow motion. great video stabilization. and most important the flagship design.....the optical camera. great clarity. ....... the only problem is batter or else totally the best phone launched by samsung. overall review..4.5 out of 5 as of the 3500 mah battery....."
639,25 June 2019,Shubham Arora,All the features have written seems to be very good but they are definitely not. Camera quality is soo poor and very weird sound of speakers.
640,27 June 2019,Parimal Agarwal,"The mobile is really good. Its very light weight & stylish. Cameras are good but not very great. Speakers are of great quality. Display is the best part, very vibrant and smooth."
641,27 June 2019,Rahul Dewra,"One ui is good.
In hand Feel is good.
Performance is really good.
Screen is good (colors are not punchy).
Back camera is good but front is average. Some issues like poor network reception & screen Sound technology doesn't work well in low network.It is taking 2.5 hrs to charge full(though it has fast charging & small 3500 mah battery).Samsung should address this issue asap."
642,7 July 2019,Chirag Gandhi,"Overall a Good Product and it has few cons also..
Pros
1)Infinity O display
2)Premium feel in hand by its look and design
3)Screen Sound Technology
4)Type C Earphone with dolby tec is amazing
5)Camera quality is Good

Cons
1)No Amoled Display
2)Battery 3500 is very poor
3)Upper design is very poor. Back body little bit better
4)Face unlock is very slow"
643,1 July 2019,Deepak Sengar,"In Slow motion video quality is pathetic from a phone in this range, In slow motion videos Light flickers, I think samsung should have tested the slow motion in artficial lights before release of phone."
644,26 June 2019,rahul gauri,"The phone performs well when considering normal use but gets heated up and starts losing battery very fast when playing games.

Another feature that is , the screen sound technology is not up to the mark when compared with normal earpiece sound output."
645,28 July 2019,Sunil Khanolkar,"Everything is good and at the place.
Samsung's USP, i.e. Super Amoled display is not in the phone hence display quality is not like other samsung mobiles.
Fingerprint reader is excellent."
646,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ashok,I don't know how Samsung got everything wrong in single mobile...camera worst..battery even more worst than camera...finger print not up to ......user experience is very bad....feel like when will I get rid of mobile...Nokia 6.1 plus was waaaaayyyyy much better...top notch...and better price....worst mistake I made so far in chosing mobiles till now...don't go for it....iam pretty sure you regret the same hour of using it
647,29 July 2019,Jagdev Kumar,"Mobile side charging port is connecting with charger but phone is not charging. Even head phone is also not connecting with phone.Due to that my mobile is not getting charge. This phone was delivered on 7th july 2019 and before completing one month , it has giving me this kind of problems.Need urgent action and support from AMAZAN team.
Thanks in advance for your kind support always."
648,29 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"The galaxy m40 works smooth and fast
The battery is enough to last for about 7 - 8 hours of continuous usage

But it lacks an oled display as that of rest of the Samsung smartphones available in the market
Battery is 3500 instead of 5000mAH

No. Problem with type -C headphones they are fine but bushes are little bit loose

The punchhole display and the look is great"
649,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Mobile delivered by the sellee was defective. Complaint registered with local support. Moblie replaced but some of the problems still persists. Voice quality of incoming call, device heating issue and battery life is some the concern with samsung must address."
650,The manufacturer commented on the review below,mandeep,"There is an issue with the earphone
It's too difficult to listen calls even in the usual noisy surroundings
Secondly it u can feel heating sensation while listening calls
Third that the concept of no conventional earphone hurts as the sound makes it little vibrate during calls"
651,15 August 2019,sumit chhabra,"Phone is good, but I will not suggest anyone to purchase this model of Samsung.
Biggest problem is with its speaker, be it ringeror speaker.
Voice is too low
I purchased for my mother and thought she would be happy,but after using for an hour she said this phone is just a piece of Junk ,coz she is not able to hear me properly via video call"
652,21 July 2019,James Bhupati ◉,"This tool is going to work very fast and smoothly.
The quality of the screen is very beautifully and glow
But due to downloading a mobile Internet and 3 to 4 hours a problem, the phone continues to heat up
So just close this phone and 15 to 20 minutes
Now switch to the phone."
653,30 September 2019,sushant Luthra,"M40 is one of the best smart phone under 20k.
Best about it.
Camera quality is best.
6 ram (phone doesn't hang even on multitasking like the previous models)
Does not bug.
Storage 128gb is superb.
Inbuilt front camera
Perfect design.
B. Bad about it
Only one colour (blue)
Glossy plastic back
Can't use it without cover.
Overall the best under 20k."
654,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Xeus Joseph,Bot the fone as a gift on 23rd June ... Speaker damaged on 1st July ... Sound was awesum wen it was new ... Within a week it sounds like a squeak .. no assistance received from amazon as the return window was invalid anymore
655,25 June 2019,Lijo Mathew,"Mobile performance and display are good. Best mobile for watching movies, Dolby Atmos feature while connecting headset is superb. Face unlock and finger print sensor are quick and fast. But front camera is not so good, mainly during indoor and low lighting conditions. Picture deatiling is poor while zooming the images."
656,22 July 2019,nagraj naik,I have to charge the mobile thrice a day as the battery backup is just 4 hours..it takes hours to charge as the charger doesn't seem like a fast charger.. didn't expect such kind of quick battery draining issue.. but the rest all features are top notch
657,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Rohit Agarwal,Problem in Phone Speaker Technology. Sound Quality is not clear. Sound Echoes.
658,25 June 2019,Ali M.,"Its the best budget phone which gives all the features of a premium smartphone at such a low price. Even though the price is low, samsung has not compromised on the quality and performance of the smartphone.

The camera is sharp and brilliant.
The feel of the touchscreen is smooth.
The RAM and Internal storage is a huge plus point.
The fingerprint and face recognition is fast."
659,27 June 2019,Prakash makwana,"-The newest feature of face unlocking is awesome
- The 6 gb ram gives thrilling gaming experience
-The back triple cameras give special help in photography

-The user interface is great!!!!!!
Love this phone !
Thankyou #samsungindia!"
660,26 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"This mobile features are not good as well they describe before launch.
1. camera quality average
2. battery capacity is low
3. mobile charger jack and earphone jacks are the same (big drawback) at same time what we do i.e. if our mobile battery is low how can we listen the music, what we do first..........."
661,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Worst phone. Finger print sensor is not as good as redmi note 5. Basically, phone audio quality is worst. Most of the time, cant hear from the other end in a call. Such a basic feature, not working. Battery life is pathetic. Redmi note 5 pro used to come for two days with mobile data, location, wifi switched on. This phone is not lasting beyond a day. Overall completely dissatisfied with this phone."
662,28 June 2019,Sheriff Judes,"pros:
1. triple camera
2. display
3. snapdragon 675
4. gaming is buttery smooth
5. gradient backside finishing which looks sexy
6. fast charging
7. lovely earphones.

cons:
1. battery could have been better.

2. incall volume is somewhat low due to the new screensound technology(hope they'll solve this issue through OTA updates)"
663,23 June 2019,Amazon Customer,It's ok only. Camera is worst if we take any picture by zooming in the pictures are getting blurred. Speaker and display are worth. Income call volume is bit low since the speaker is placed at the top. Worth 3 stars. The phone gets heated when we talk in whatsapp.
664,29 August 2019,Vivek,"Camara quality is very poor .. not expected from Samsung phone... Battery life not as expected it is clearly mentioned in product.. that battery is checked by 3rd party and Samsung does not take any garrenty for this. Not that satisfied with product hope software updates can do something for improvement.
Suggest to go for another product..."

668,25 June 2019,sayan s,"I am not a gamer guy and primarily needed a phone with good camera and audio. So M40 fulfilled that!!!

Features which I liked:

Ergonomically very handy and sleek
Punch hole looks quite appealing
Screen sound tech is also unique
Decent camera
Dolby Atmos is great for audio
Fast Charging"
669,28 June 2019,Sushil Mishra,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews are there,

If we compare camsra with Realme 3pro, realme x or vivi z1 then this has the best camera.I have personally matched all three phones

If you want premium phone in 20k then M40 will be your choice..Best Camera Awesome look...Looks and feel great in hand...Awesome Display"
670,26 June 2019,IamSilversterGlad,"I was using Samsung Galaxy S8 previously from Aug 17 till June 19 and I don't find any difference between S8 and M40. I would say this is the best budget galaxy phone one can own which comes under 20k. Using Offers, I bought it for 18.3k. The camera is good and the battery life is far better as it crosses a day i.e. 24 hours completely since 100% charge with all features and 4G turned on 24*7."
671,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Pritam Kumar Nath, Very disappointed with the order. Within just two days of use its giving a display issue
672,25 June 2019,Venugopal Gadiparthi,"Faced heating issues in
1. while Using charging phone
2. camera for 10min
We can use only either 2nd sim or SD card once. We can't use both once.
Even earphones also not suites to my ears.
Buying a mobile phone through ""Amazon"" also worst experience, flipkart is double better on this. When asked for replacement, Scheduled for mobile Inception, no proper service on this. agent updated wrong feedback"
673,8 August 2019,Rahul Bhairat,Everything is ok in this phone bt problem is battery backup. Within one day it's discharged. Fast charging works charge in 45min.i dislike this phone i think a50 is best than this. So confused
674,4 July 2019,yash,The phone is very good in every thing but the display and the camera of thia phone is qorst the camera is like 5000 rs phone and the display is not even super amoled . Cmmon man i spent 20000 on this and didn't get all this so the price is not worth.
675,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Rocky,"Strictly it's a Regret phone from Samsung.
Poor battery backup👎
Poor selfie camera👎
Poor performance still with SD675👎👎👎
Shud compromises everything with this phone."
676,27 June 2019,Hitesh Bhandari,"Recently bought this beutiful phone. Just loved it. It's amazing with its brilliant design n awesome display, very very smooth. Good battery. Not a heavy duty user thus I have 60% battery left even after 24 hrs. Comes with a fast charger. Cameras are good. The only issue I noticed with phone is that it got heats up after few hours of continuous use. But for me its great fun at great price."
677,17 August 2019,Shikher Bhatnagar,"Camera is horrible, pictures quality is not as per sandards, it seems like Samsung has lost their focus on quality...There is dust in the camera which is not at all acceptable and customer care is pathetic.
Audio Jack and charging are same so you can use one at time or you should have bluetooth every where.
This product was made in hurry keeping quality at stake."
678,25 June 2019,akshay,"It's the best devices i have ever used.
It's stylish look mesmorises me every time.
Infinity O display with punch hole is the best part of it.
Trust me u will not regret.
Pros: infinity O display and design
Samsung please increase battery capacity next time.

Update:
1. now got problem with charging port.
2. In call ear piece is not at all good."
679,30 September 2019,Upendra Joshi,"Overall Very good product.
Specs wise overpriced.
Camera is on little bit lower side.
Face recognition should be improved.
All other things are quite good.."
680,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ravi gupta,Very very very very very dusgustive bad defective prodect. I suggest everyone think thousands and millions of time to buy it. Battery life is extremely low. Set heats as if it gonna blast while using. The charger & earphone stoped working within a week. Camera quality is also not good as compare to other samsung handsets. Choosing this set is wasting of money and filling with frustations.
681,26 June 2019,ABHISHEK DWIVEDI,"I would have given zero to phone .
On screen sound technology is worst
The phone has connectivity issues
Dont buy does not worth 20k"
682,28 June 2019,Nilesh,"The phone is good. But it has a TYPE - C charging pin. So I had to carry two chargers with me as I also have Samsung J7.

Also , I forgot to mention my GST details on ordering the phone. So I request STPL to give me a new invoice with my GST details."
683,17 July 2019,malkani,"This phone has speaker problem, you can't hear clearly on calls, it has some design issue, it's hardware issue, right now don't buy this product and m sure Samsung will solve the problem soon. So please buy after new lot is out for sale."
684,17 October 2019,Ghanshyam Bhagnani,"Received the product on 15th October
Very good phone, got it for Rs.13419 on exchange with Redmi note 4 32GB on Great indian festival sale
Camera and display is just excellent."
685,30 July 2019,Sushant Sanu,Phone is really awesome if we talk about build quality and about the look. I bought this because I was not interested in Chinese phones. Phone is really cool and feels like premium. Only concern is it's camera. In low light front camera is not at the best level but rear camera works very fine witb flash. Overall it is value for money at this price range.
686,17 July 2019,Aviral Bajpai,Firstly I would say that the cocktail orange m40 is surely the best looking phone under 20k. The display is just fantastic. Just don't listen to people crying for amoled display . For best camera performance use gcam for the selfies and shoot on 3:4h resolution settings for primary camera and the results would be more than satisfactory.
687,29 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"the phone samsung galaxy m40 very good and very attractive smart phone
and the phone performance is excellent and camera's are best and the storage of the device is 128 GB
samsung galaxy M40 is best phone in this range i like it the most"
688,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Mujeeb Ahmed,"I just simply trusted Samsung and amazon and wasted my 20k, i should use headphones to talk it's horrible to carry all the time cheated smasung and amazon"
689,31 July 2019,Rashmi Ranjan Patnaik,It's not what I'd hoped it would be. Battery performance is the worst. It lasts about 21/2 hours to 3 hours if you continuously watch videos and listen to music. Biometric Reader is much slower on most of the occasions and face unlock takes more than 2 sec at times and doesn't detect the face even if the room is a little bit dark. So my advice is don't go for it. It's a waste of 20k..
690,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"The price of the mobile could have been set to lower price.

My views on this mobile after 20 days of usuage:

Build quality: Average
Camera: Moderate
Touch: Moderate
Performance: Moderate

The earphones which was given in the box are of very cheap quality and much disappointed."
691,The manufacturer commented on the review below,nikhil agrawal,"Samsung has provided a Very poor quality front camera. It seems to be VGA Camera to me.
Phone heats a lot. And the sound quality while talking is horrible. You have to check again and again if the sound volume is appropite or not."
692,22 June 2019,Amazon Customer,Excellent displt and the clock speed of the processor. The Antutu and other scores are also in same league as of Redmi note pro .
693,23 June 2019,sayantan sen,"Good product
Camera not bad as others saying...i felt its quite good..
Will update after some extensive use..."
694,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amir,"This product is approximately 2K expensive than M30 just because of Camera MP. But, 32MP camera is only in written. This 32MP camera feels like 13MP. Not really happy with this.

Rest, mobile looks decent and other features are superb."
695,20 July 2019,Aditya Sethi,"I recieved product today itself and have been using it since that time, this is for the first time i have ever purchased a samsung device and this is a really good device. I am really enjoying using it, the device is so smooth in texture, feature like glass feel from back and the infinite touch display is realy amazing.
This is a great device in everything."
696,29 June 2019,Joseph Vathalloor,"Stylish phone, Love the premium feeling with the Infinity O display. Camera is respectable. Loved the pictures, but can't compare it to premium phones.
Another advantage is it's light weight.
Didn't like the On Screen sound as it give the feeling of hollow sound.
Supports only C type headphone."
697,29 June 2019,Kedar Patil,"Review after 1 week of use :
I was very confused before buying this phone because of it's LCD display and 3500mAh battery. But after using this for a week it's clear that the battery is more than enough for whole day of use, and the display is amazing. No regrets so far. The camera is moderate though. The wide capture is a perk. The punch-hole display looks great."
698,6 July 2019,Devansh,"Like :- Camera quality could be best in this range.
Display is unique.
Quality of display is also great.
Fast UI and Powerful hardware.
Fast Charging and In-box Fast charger.
Output of USB Type-C port for Music is great and In-Box Type-C Earphone. Earphone quality is also Good.
Dislike:- Only two things Battery life could be better and No headphone Jack"
699,25 October 2019,Joe,"Product is not a three slot and I was not satisfied. Amazon refused to replace with three slot phone. Will never again buy expensive item on Amazon. Will use them for grocery so they can go on loss.

Moreover the package was tampered as the ejection pin was misssing.

On the whole a poor show by Samsung and amazon."
700,6 July 2019,NIDISH ANAND,The product is very Good and awesome . I reaceied it very safely from amazon. But the only con with this phone is its battery life is some what short. But charging speed is Very good.And the front punch hole camera's quality is some What low. But over all I loved it.
701,27 June 2019,Sarumathi,"Overall, the performance of the phone is really good. The only let down I feel is that the performance of the front camera is poor, especially under low lighting conditions. I wish Samsung could fix this issue with an update. Other than that it has a pretty decent Battery life. The phone feels fast and smooth"
702,22 June 2019,Abhishek kumar,Mobile is good but battery performance less. Camera is not upto mark
703,11 September 2019,Pallavi Patil,"Does anyone else have the same problem? I got my fone 1 week ago. Now its repeatedly becoming unresponsive. The prompt reads ""system UI not responding ""

After selecting close app the fone restarts on its own. After logging in thru password entry, it shuts again within 30- 45 seconds."
704,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Gajendra Shinde,"Please don't buy this M40 phone. Main draw back is sound quality. We can't hear properly with whom we are speaking to. Samsung must fix this problem, this is because of display speakers technology. But it's not good at all.
It's heating up rapidly during calls.
Other things are good but basic hearing problem is worst. Worst. Worst.
Zero star."
705,26 June 2019,mohamed rizwan,"Pros:

Good spec with this price range.
No Lagging.
Performance was fantastic

Cons:
Heating Issue
No 3.5 mm jack (Even they provided C type headphone)
It was not getting charged quick, But given charger is fast charger
Selfi Camera not upto the mark
On screen speaker gives us echo type of sound quality
Battery is to low"
706,1 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"The M-40 Series is really so wonderfull in terms of look,design,performance with this newly added feature of ""O"" .
I have switched Samsung After 5 years Since Galaxy S Series.
And its being back to home Feeling after so much switches...
Really You will never disappoint to have this in your Pocket."
707,2 August 2019,nagashri,"One of the worst mobile phone i have ever bought! Pathetic phone and its performance. Absolute waste of money. I have been running around like a crazy to get a replacement. Spoke to amazon customer care , Samsung customer care , but no use ! I would strongly do not recommend this phone to anyone. Amazon customer care sucks !!! World's most customer centric company- is an eye wash !"
708,28 June 2019,Dr Subramanyam K,Not bad. We expected more clarity in camera. In glass speaker is very bad and missed voice clarity. Head phones are good. But C type is not acceptable.
709,26 June 2019,Jitendra Verma,"Samsung m40 front camera is in display and looking very nice.
In display sound wo makes phone more beautiful
Because there not a earpiece speaker in front.
Phone has earphone different than normal earphone.
It give surround sound.
C type fast charging support.
Headphone also c type port."
710,30 July 2019,Himanshu Pandey,"This phone a unique design ,camera quality very neutral,but battery life not gud,I have fully charged 10 am and evening 8 PM phone battery ded. So u want battery backup don't buy."
711,7 August 2019,priya,"With massive disappointment, I write that I am not happy with this purchase. Within a month the earphones have stopped connecting.. No words, I have lost trust in SAMSUNG completely. What is the point of buying a new phone and then visiting the service center this early? poor, bad."
712,27 September 2019,ARBAB KHAN,"Mobile is good at this price. I am surprised M30 is lanched at a lesser price with a steong battery. Other thsn battery, the mobile lives up to its expectation"
713,28 June 2019,Ajay Kumar,"Overall phone is good... But it could be more effective with upgraded chipset of Snapdragon 855.

Sound quality in headset is ok (Not Bad).

Infinty display is awesone..

Front camera in M40 is not upto the mark, there is too much of softness included.

No Case provided in box.

Overall M40 is good hand piece for budget of 20k."
714,28 June 2019,Navi saidawat,"Screen is most liked by me... It's infinity 'O' design is awesome feels like full screen....
Poor Face unlock, unlocks even with closed eyes... Fingerprint unlock is alo Ok
Camera is just good in hardware but disappoints in output, phones in 15/16 k range results in good image and you'll feel annoyed when one of your friends did challenge you with same 15/16k device."
715,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,All the bezel free experoence is not good ..sound quality is not good unable to hear voice of caller .phone heating issue during call .not expected to samsung phone .plz dont purchase this phone .i got this phone on 16 july n will return this soon..
716,The manufacturer commented on the review below,manju pandey,While talking it is very difficult to hear voice of caller. Do not buy. Wastage of money. You will surely feel regret if buy. Worst phone from samsung
717,29 June 2019,MASHARUDDIN.A,"Samsung M40 starting from the adds and promo from amazon its created huge buzz. And it's delivered the same in the product as well. Well crafted design with display.
Given type c quality headphone which is smart move .
Snapdragon processor which is the biggest positive.
Ram & storage will definently serve your money .
Best and reliable @ this price range ."
718,25 June 2019,Saksham Tiwari,"Superb phone. Awesome body and design. The glass back looks beautiful. The best thing on this device is the powerful Snapdragon 675 chipset. The screen quality is awesome. Fluid like touch and an awesome camera too. The wide angle lens is awesome. Speakers are also pretty decent
Only one con- no 3.5mm headphone jack but thanks to Samsung for adding those type c earphones"
719,27 June 2019,Mihir panchal,"Samsung M40 mobile handset very modern design
With infinite O display. It's looking amazing.
According to price, the camera is fantastic. Low light
The picture is not accurate but its sharpness is good.
During game play, it's quite heating. C type charger
is nice but C type headphone Jack is not a good idea.
And there is no Samsung pay support."
720,The manufacturer commented on the review below,MOHAMMAD SAUD,i used this mobile 3 days . Mobile is heating too much while charging or using WiFi/Hotspot. It also heating while talking more than 3 minutes. Amazon not replacing the item although i am a prime member of him.. Poor service. I suggest Don't buy this phone go for another option.
721,27 June 2019,Aniket kumar,"Very Fast fingerprint sesor &Camera is Marvelous Front facing camera is very nice and back Camera is also very nice, & Battery is also good and due to fast charging this becomes Awesome..Overall the whole Specification of M40 is Fantastic and worth buying than other and Chinese brands phone"
722,The manufacturer commented on the review below,jagjivan chauhan,"Dont buy........Pathetic mobile phone in terms of in - call voice quality. Sound is totally inaudible even at silent place.Moreover sound distorted and very low even at full volume setting.
Don't buy it guys as it's service centre technician know this problematic feature but can not do anything."
723,5 September 2019,Gaurav Singh,"Very impressed with the overall performance. Yes it does lag a bit when heavy games are run but other than that the TFT display, the premium feel and the camera everything are amazing. The 3500 mah battery also surprised me. It lasts longer than my Redmi Note 4 that has 4000 mah. Best phone in budget if you're not a gaming freak and looking for a premium phone. Go for it !"
724,2 October 2019,JK,"Finger print sometimes slow.. Good display and touch ,battery drains fastly... Camera good, but not good in low light .. crispness is less even with 3 lenses"
725,28 June 2019,urvashi rathore,"1) Camera Quality Nowhere Matches 32 Mp .
2) Battery Backup is Decent, Need to be Charged Twice in a Day.
3) Look is Awesome.
4) Sound Quality Through Screen in Poor.
5) No Separate Jack for Headphone.
6) Heating is also Observed.
7) Earphone Quality NOT Good.
8) I Find it to be Expensive for rupees 19990."
726,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Indian,"I am writing this reveiw after 3 weeks of purchase.

POOR BATTERY LIFE, DRAINS BATTERY VERY QUICKLY, FLOP MODEL IN M SERIES, I SUGGEST BETTER TO OPT FOR M20. I have earlier bought M20 and the performance was Excellent"
727,18 October 2019,Parekh Parth Vijaykumar,"Processing os faster enough to make experience smoother.

Camera quality is good as well. But, suffers in low light.

Fingerprint and Face Recognition works too good and accurate.

Infinitive O display is superb.

4 starts because of low light camera performance. Otherwise for all other modules, 5* are appropriate ."
728,17 July 2019,Suvashish Nayak,"If you need a good looking phone, then this will be the beat option for you under 20k. But the camera quality is very bad except that wide angle camera features. Battery life is also average kind."
729,20 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Don't buy this phone, C charger and headphone Jack is same, once you remove the headset/headphones you can't use it in hand free or headset mode to listen music or call unless you restart. I think SAMSUNG hurried up in launching this phone without addressing or identifying the technical problems, u can never reach the level of I phones. :("
730,6 July 2019,Narendra,"Battery is disappointing
Color is cool
Camera is not up to mark"
731,9 October 2019,Akhil Kumar,"Superb Product launch by Samsung it’s really money worth it product
First time I was disappointed by amazon i am unable but booked order getting server and other etc error while trying to purchase.
But now finally I have this phone is with me.

Feel like family shop

Thanks Amazon"
732,4 July 2019,Amazon_Customer,"A very good mobile from Samsung in this price range. The overall performance of the device is nice and the infinity o display gives a premium look. Everything is good but just the front camera needs some improvement and also if this mobile was available in black colour I would have liked it more.
But overall a pretty decent price for this amazing Galaxy M40 mobile."
733,6 October 2019,nitin verma,"Worst mobile at this prize..
1. Camera quality-below average
2. Battery draining fast
3. Inbuilt Speaker is worst
4.saala yaha tak play store ki jagah galaxy store se app download ho raha hai...kisi Naye bande ke liye muskil hai wo play store se app download kar sake...kisi ko pata ho to batana plz settings Kaise change karen"
734,17 July 2019,Aakash 😎,"Its Processor is awesome..Performance is awesome...Gameplay is smooth...
PubG can be played smoothly with high definition ultra quality...Camera quality is good but could have been more better...
But its battery capacity is low and not up to the mark..Its only 3500 maH which is low and discharge early.."
735,21 June 2019,jayesh,"Very cute & smart below 20k
Excellent features"
736,25 June 2019,Rishi,Verry poor sound n camera quality not worth of 20000
737,28 June 2019,Amazon Customer,Love the phone. Snapdragon processor works really fast without any lag. Love the screen resolution. Great clarity and viewing angles. Camera quality is not that good as it pixelate when you take picture. Since camera is not my priority so it works for me. Also the volume from speaker is not that loud but does the work. I am really happy and satisfied with this phone😊
738,3 August 2019,Amazon Customer,It is very nice phone easy to handle with good quality of camera the shade is really awesome the face unlock work very good happy to buy this phone thank you amazon
739,2 September 2019,Nayana,"Battery life is poor.
I haven't seen anything great about the Camera quality as
yet.

Product damaged. The conversion plug has already ceased to function after just a few days use!"
740,17 July 2019,Ankit,"Face reading is slow and also the experience while playing pubg is not up to ...
Worst quality plastic used..
I have been using cover to protect it and still lots of scratches..
Scratches even on finger print..
Over priced ... not upto mark...
Realme is far better or redmi note 7 pro..."
741,3 August 2019,Abhi,"Battery life is average
Primary camera's quality is pretty good but when it comes to the front camera it extremely below average.
For me ,the ui ,brand and the looking of punch hole camera is superior to the camera and battery that's why i bought this. If cameras and batteries matter to you better go with some other Chinese cheaper smartphones."
742,21 August 2019,Tyagi,"Camera: quality is good but not perfect.
Battery: fast charging but backup is little less but adequate.
Appearance: perfect, smooth, classy, adorable...totally mind-blowing.
Sensors: all sensors are working extremely fine.
overall: I will give 4.6 out of 5 ratings."
743,29 June 2019,CRR INFRATECH AND FINANCE PVTLTD,Samsung M40 with 6GB ROM and 128 GB internal memory is a excellent mobile with very resolution rear camera and sensitive finger touch. It's a treat watching video in full screen and working on net with fast processor. Battery life is fairly ok as of now however it is to be seen in long term. Overall a mobile value for its money and strongly recommended for purchase.
744,28 June 2019,johny,"Awesome phone.
Good display with punch hole camera.
Awesome to watch the videos.
should have improved battery back up and camera.
low variant phones have amoled display and this one lacks it
Screen sound technology is worst
Should have sold only through flash sale .
Discontinuing flash sale has completely brought down its market."
745,26 June 2019,Irfan,"Great Smartphone under 20k budget with features like Punch hole Display , Triple Camera, Customizable OS , 6GB Ram and 128GB Storage. Feels good & Light in the hand.

But I think A30 might be good option than this."
748,28 June 2019,Anil .M,"What i like is the display quality, notch display and ease of access applications , battery life , colour , design, smart lock features

What i dont like is face recognisation is slow , sometimes it dont work , in night never use face recognisation. Camera quality is not good specially front cam , phone is bit slippery but can be controllrd by back cover"
749,19 August 2019,prince sharma,"The worst product i have purchased in my life . Its been a month i have purchased this phone and i face many problems like camera issues and now the sim slot is not working i have visited service centre from 5 days they kept my phone . Due to this i get very upset that i made this mistake i have purchased this phone
Worst phone ever in my life 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
750,29 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Product is #omg as is said by company.
Loved it😘 feels premium and rigid ,light weight,camera quality is good ,fingerprint is much better than A50. Heated a bit for 1-2 days but now feels normal after some days of use. Battery backup is good . Display is not amoled but is better than other devices of this range ,punchhole design is awesome."
751,25 June 2019,mohit srivastava,"This phone is the best phone in this price segment.
I like the most about it is its infinity o display which gives a luxurious feeling. Camera quality is awesome.Speed is amazing.Everything is good.
Some people are blaming that its battery is only 3500 mah but it is sufficient for whole day at least for me."
752,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Rahul Gupta,"Bought it as a gift and now I feel stupid. You don’t want to gift someone special and then have them run around service centers for a stupid phone. Basic call functionality doesn’t work. Too noisy to talk. The speakers for call feature are the worst thing ever invented. I personally never liked Samsung, this buy just gave me a reason to hate it."
753,5 September 2019,Kuldeep Prakash Singh,"Worst phone ever, it doesn't work properly.
Even worst is amazon representative, my phone isn't working and they are telling to install an app on the same phone then only replacement can be arrange, or else keep waiting...... They will be repeating the same statement again and again and will treat you as if you have never ever have seen any smartphone....."
754,28 October 2019,Kuldeep,"Samsung Galaxy M40 is best phone under 20,000 chost ...
I am satisfied with spending money in this phone ...

I recommend this product to purchase 👍👍"
755,26 June 2019,Srikar,"Everything is bad about this phone. It's a compromised model. If you're reading this, go buy A50 which is THE BEST. Samsung is fooling around with its customers and so is Amazon. So please don't get deceived."
756,1 July 2019,Rahul Kumar Singh,"Likes- Punch hole display, nice OS, finger print reader is working fine.

Dislikes - Performance of front and back camera is poor. Super amoled screen should have been used instead of TFT display though it works well, battery should have been alteast 4000mah, 3.5mm jack missing which is really a big disappointment for users. On screen feature is missing."
757,31 July 2019,Rishi,"Pro : Awesome look, light weight, runs smooth, camera is great, great experience at reasonable price! PUBG expression is way better!

Cons : Since it's punchhole so no notification light. Phone sound is lesser compared to others."
758,23 June 2019,Ahmed S.,"Mobile Speaker Quality is very bad, due to screen speaker out put... You can't keep phone at the Ear For 10 mins to speak... U get continue vibration and noise...

759,23 June 2019,Amazon Customer,Good Budget Phone with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM.....slim and light.weight....issue only with Battery .....slow charging though they claim fast charging
760,1 July 2019,Nitin goswami,"Nice product must buy.
SAR value just 0.2 so very cool in terms of health. All other company product have high SAR value.
6 GB RAM+ 128 GB ROM is a awesome combo in this price range.
Snapdragon 675 is enough.
Camera very cool.

Just battery is ok.

Otherwise go for it. Not comparable with other mobile brands."

762,21 July 2019,Chandrasekhar Reddy,"Performance of mobile pretty good.
But, Camera quality wise was very awful.

764,6 August 2019,suman,"Just to avoid Chinese mobiles, i choose Samsung though it is not par with other Chinese competitor models.
Total disappointment with Battery life, not even 12 hrs with basic usage [Whatsapp,call and browsing]...not even single game installed.
Recommended to not to buy M40, not sure about other models."
765,The manufacturer commented on the review below,ajay bhalerao,"Not worth to buy , battery is very weak in terms of stand by time also fast charging is only for marketing in reality it doesn't hv fast charging instead it takes normal charging time .

Asthetically phone looks good n attractive.

No headphone jack , only one slot for charging n same for type C headphones which is provided by samsung"
766,25 June 2019,akshay dimble,"Nice product.
Good camera clarity
Good speed

Slow motion and super slow motion best

Altogether good phone at affordable price in its category"

769,The manufacturer commented on the review below,amritansh pandey,"Only mobile look is good, but camera quality is to poor, mobile heat to much, battery life not good,
Don't buy this mobile, waste of money, Samsung making fool of customers , and there is no return policy, don't buy this"
770,30 August 2019,Tejal,A perfect midrange phone offered by Samsung with a powerful processor and brilliant camera that allows us to capture beautiful images.The finger print sensor responds quickly. One thing I loved the most was the placement of front facing camera which occupies very less space and helps us to use the entire screen without any interruption.
771,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Bought this mobile, barely used for a month. Stopped charging with the charger provided. Tried with another cable, only to heat so much in few minutes, that it stopped charging. Now Samsung says that they do not cover the charge and asked me to pay for it. Have been using Oppo past 2years, and Moto before. Never had such issues with them"
772,10 September 2019,Vivek Sharma,"A customer is not a technical person, the purpose of my buying this phone was that I wanted two sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot. It was mentioned hybrid slot. How the heck a user in the world know what is a hybrid slot? The purpose of me buying this phone failed."
773,22 June 2019,Bhajneek s.,"Premium looks like s10
Good camera
Best phone in this price range
Best performance, great looks,awesome features"
774,23 June 2019,Vinit,"At this price, along with a brand value of Samsung, a perfect piece of cellphone one can have. Fully equipped with latest faetures available in market. Cons get diminished in front of pros."
775,23 June 2019,Abhishek Pandey,Good phone with good performance and great UI but poor battery life. Fingerprint reader is a bit slow. Rear camera is good but could have been great. Screen is bright and vibrant still the feel of AMOLED misses out. In display speaker is the worst thing about this phone. You can't hear a word if you are on road.
776,29 June 2019,Muthu Ganapathi m,The phone look is really amazing and it attract many people the fingef print sensor works well but it is too small the works well but it is not shooting amazing photo the battery life is enough for normal use and it is not okay for heavy use .the charging speed is too fast nearly it takes one and half to charge completely and over performance is okay
777,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Kiran kumar,"Plz avoid buying ....
1 ) Voice quality during the call is very poor. May be due to on display earpiece. Very bad experience. Moreover one cannot replace or return the item. Amazon is not letting to do so
2) phone is heating up very badly...Worst experience battery drains fast...many applications not supported ...voice clarity very bad...."
778,26 June 2019,SWAPNALI,"A good phone for a affordable price. Good attempt by Samsung. The O'corner front camera adds to the beauty of this lil masterpiece.
Pros:
Battery life.
Smooth touch
Great UI

Cons:
Commmon slot for earphone & charger
Ear phones quality
Missing blue light filter(hope it is back in near furture updates)"
779,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Veera Shaji Ghate,"worst mobile
Mobile is not getting on"
780,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Neeraj Pathak,Battery Life is worst part of Phone Finger print reader is same category in last movement Camera is ordinary like 5K value phones quality. My suggestion don't go with Amazon go your local market purchase A50 A60 A70 ... Very Good options.
781,24 August 2019,Arvind,"Very poor phone. Due to new on screen technology there is very poor quality of incoming voice n outgoing voice n any speaker related voice. And the worst part is amazon is not helping you regarding this issue. They just said we cannot help you regarding your complains. So in future am not going to buy anything from amazon.
They need only their commissions."
782,The manufacturer commented on the review below,RASAPELLI RAMESH,"Poor battery backup,worst screen sound output quality,face unlock not working properly,selfie quality is average and unlock the phone if ur eyes r closed
But phone working smoothly,
If u think brought this....think one more time
Because main problem is battery drain"
783,27 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Best smartphone under 20k i ever seen, the infinity O display is looks amazing and flagship grade. Also the fingerprint reader
is very fast This smartphone not only comes with amazing display but also it's come Snapdragon 675 which gives seamless performance."
784,12 July 2019,dev,"Very fast fingerprint and facetime unlock response.
Decent battery backup
Display is just okay, not to the Samsung standards
Average camera quality, just basic quality picture"
785,1 July 2019,Mukul Sehra,"Display : perfect! though its not amoled but it looks superb
Call quality : decent, the point i was scared for before ordering. With on screen sound tech, you have to just keep the vol max that's all.
Battery : decent
Overall a stunner with the cutting edge technology
The phone looks beautiful in Seawater color"
786,21 August 2019,Prathmesh Khot,"Positives: Fast, good looking, light, good colors, fair camera quality.

Negetives: Clumsy user interface in some apps, charging takes longer time as compared to other makes, front camera needs improvement.

All in all a good deal for the price...."
787,28 June 2019,Vamshi lakshman,"I seriously loved the mobile it's very good and the battery life is decent, the camera is awesome I loved the camera the camera performs good in low light conditions also. Snapdragon 675 is really good and it performs very good while playing games there is no lag or something like that. The phone is simply smooth. It's worth for the price rate."
788,26 June 2019,Shraiyansh Gautam,The fingerprint reader unlocks phone very quick and the camera quality is superb as it gives 32mp back camera and the selfie camera is great only in terms of battery life the people who plays games contiously for 4-5 hours have to charge their phone in between the game but for the people who play only for 1-2 hours for them this device is great.
789,25 June 2019,Reshma Suresh,"I've ordered the phone on 18th July. Got it delivered in 2 days. My experience with the phone had so far been great. The camera quality and infinity o display is worth mentioning. The infinity display gives the phone a classy look. Battery life is also great. To sum it up, Samsung M40 is definitely a good option among phones in the 20k budget."
790,10 July 2019,suvankar Chakraborty,The phone is good ..and fits the budget..I like it..awsome headphone...but speaker sound #while calling# is a problem a sathe phone has no internal calling speaker..scrennvibrates to produce sound..some how feels irritating during long talk...over all 9/10...marks Samsung..
791,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Worst speaker. New technology as speaker screen is very bad to hear the call voice and call hearing is not at all clear.
There is no support from amazon too to return the part. Worst experience."
792,25 June 2019,Ankit Jaiswal,I am in love with this phone. I like to show of the punch hole camera that samsung delivered in this price segment. Very good display. The phone is super fast and the camera is good. The dual tone color looks very premium. The SST is also great that I was worried for. This is the first phone in this price segment.
793,30 June 2019,abdul hafeel,"Looking very good design, processor ok, battery 3500 is cons, it is 100 % copy of galaxy A60,"
794,30 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"Good phone. Value for money. Samsung's software needs more refinement. But no better alternatives. Note below:
Reset phone on delivery for better camera experience. Phone doesn't light up for incoming notifications."
795,25 June 2019,Amazon Customer,Samsung could have used 5000mah as M30
796,18 August 2019,sahoda sri sharani,"I have bought the phone for exchange at 16.5K, I think for the price I have paid it is good phone except for the type-c earphones."
797,22 August 2019,HIMANSU BHUSAN MISHRA,Not good but bad shows dual sim you can insurt 2nd sim if you insurt memory card and front camera is not good and display is not good SAMSUNG A50 IS BEST than SAMSUNG M40
798,8 October 2019,Bhumit Bumiya,"In M40, every feature is nice and perfect. Camera quality is very good. Only 1 thing is I think should be better that is battery life. If I play games like Asphalt 9 and pubg continously for 2-3 hours battery goes 100 to directly 35%. But overall I can give 4 star to this phone. Could have gave 4.5 if battery life is better."
799,16 July 2019,purushuttam verma,Amazon has sold me the poor quality mobile which have automatically started display problem and touch problems without any damage. Amazon should check the quality of mobile Samsung Galaxy m 40
800,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Third class
Incoming call voice problem plz don’t buy never never I order 2 mobile and both are same problem
Third class display
Camera is same like chines phone"
801,26 June 2019,Vamsi,Only camera is enhanced than M30. Battery and screen very lowered than M30. We would expect every aspect of M40 to be better than it predecessor. Where some of the features are lacking behind though the price is hiked.
802,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Looks wise mobile is good but comes to the working conditions it is laggy , especially when I plug in the earphones type c , mobile is getting laggy and struck, camera is not up to the mark , front camera is worst , screen sound technology needs to get improved ."
803,3 July 2019,Ram Pal,"I bought this phone 1st july 2019, Everything OK but C port audio jack is big issue. There is big problem in this phone ""in display speaker"". When you call someone or received any call then you can not hear properly. It seems that phone is vibrating while you are on call. I am thinking to return this phone due to its in display technology"
804,20 July 2019,champak g.,"Please dont buy this phone.worst sound ever.its not even audible,lots of distortion and noise.but the worst part is worst service centre they wont even replace your phone if you are not satisfied.they will make you do a stupid test which doesnt give any result and you will have to be stuck with the phone even if you are not happy with it."
805,The manufacturer commented on the review below,shweta,"1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good
2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. Voice quality during the call is very poor. Sounds Robotic and its really hard to understand the caller. May be due to on display earpiece. ... Very bad experience"
806,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,its switch off automatically in day 2 to 3 times....iam facing this problem from the past3 days ...now this is high time. Dont make me to regrett..i purchase is it from amazon...rven all my friends toĺd me not buy it
807,26 October 2019,Prakash Jha,Pathetic product. Doesn't have an ear piece. Samsung's design is faulty and the voice is muffled. All the M40s will have the same issue but Amazon is not acknowledging the issue and helping the customer.
808,29 June 2019,Himanshu Malik,Finger print reader is very fast. Camera quality is very good in a day or night.Battery life not bad. I am playing pubg 5 to 8 matches in a day. After playing game my battery percantage is 30 to 35 %.But i am facing a problem if i attached earphone in port then screen touch work very hard. Many times the touch does not work.
809,The manufacturer commented on the review below,saurabh,The overall voice through the screen is wierd and not an advisable move. Furthermore it seems the device doesn't connect well through hotspots and its network strength management is poor to say the least.
810,28 June 2019,Aakash,"Worst Camera Quality.
battery is draining so quickly.
Need to improve screen sound technology can't even hear.
Also loud speakers are not good .
touch screen also not working properly.
only good thing is it's look .."
811,28 June 2019,Shubham chauhan,"I got my M40 via Amazon, a great delivery asusual. M40 is the finest quality phone of Samsung. detailing on it body nd display is attractive. An another new thing is its display voice technology.but i faced i problem since 2 days,the sensor of the mobile is not working properly.but in all the rest it is the best samsung gadget i hv got."
812,31 August 2019,Amazon Customer,"Finger print reader is not that quick but can live with it. Camera bug has been sorted after an update, battery life will stand for whole day. Display is good but I would like the Samoled display rather than this TFT"
813,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Shamila,Camera quality and sound system also very bad and I am not all satisfied with this product.Amazon should return policy for this kind of phones so the customer who brought by mistake will go for other one
814,25 June 2019,Amazon Customer,Worst audio quality..audio technology used is not suitable for phone..you can't listen properly when you are outside..womodel is not meeting basic requirements..Amazon should recall the product and return money..
815,21 August 2019,Rohan s Walunj,"Please do not purchase this product as it is restarting daily automatically without any intimations and apps also getting closed without error message, after 6 GB RAM performance is not that much good.
Manufacturer don't for 6 GB RAM and 128 storage how much power will get consumed that battery must 5000 MH atleast."
816,3 July 2019,Alexx,"The voice quality of speakers during calls is not at all good. Please try to improve it during a software update. The front camera isn't worth 16MP, it looks like a 5MP or lesser. The back camera of 32MP alone is not cool at all. The pixel breaks and very poor inside houses where there is poor lightening."
817,26 June 2019,Himanshu singh,Slight heating issue when watched videos for long time.Very nice phone with very good looks having a punch hole display gives a very premium look to the phone premium look to the phone. Nice camera and quality. Quick face unlock unlocks the phone in seconds. Premium display quality gives very vibrant colors. Feels good during watching movies.
818,25 June 2019,Gaurav Kalebere,"Overall it's very good product. Simple, elegant and fun to use. I didn't come across any big drawback or problem with this phone but on-screen audio is little bit problematic, when ambient sounds/noice is high it gets difficult to hear properly through screen."
819,24 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"The phone is lovely . Doesnt feel like its samsung anymore !
Its worth to buy . Camera is also pretty good overall the phone is a satisfactory product.. the phone can manage multiple task simultaneously efficiently ok the camera struggles in low light but overall video recording is great"
820,17 September 2019,Buvanesh,Worst product to buy..waste for money..basic call quality is not functioning properly..not able to hear other end..gets heated very easily..please don't buy this phone..in spite of all the promise made about the quality and failing to do so they do not accept return..deeply disappointed with Amazon.
821,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Nanda,If u charge fully and keep ur phone in switched off for a day and then turn on the phone. Your battery will have only 20% charge. Imagine if ur phone is in switched on mode. U will not get the battery for couple of hours. Worst phone by Samsung. Raised complaint with Amazon. Engineer visit scheduled.
822,24 June 2019,Biswanath Deb,The product is overall good at this price specially from Samsung. Only Cons is the Speaker system in the display. This is new idea but sound is not clear. Traditional speaker is better. This is my personal opinion.
823,21 June 2019,Enam Singh,Overall very nice mobile .
824,30 July 2019,YK Naidu,"Weast product, earphones not connecting to phone and automatically restart the mobile, not comfortable touch and customer support very very bad so many times calling no response.

826,The manufacturer commented on the review below,MOHSIN,I m note happy samsung m40 product
827,12 September 2019,Ravikumar,"1.Main drawback of this mobile is not fast charging mobile. It's taking nearly 2 hrs of time get full charge. 😥
2. Most of the videos (like prime,via, airteltv etc )are not playing on full screen mode.🙄
3. Not supporting Samsung pay.😑
4. Good thing is , liked sound screen technology. 👍"
828,5 August 2019,vashist kumar singh,"I have received this phone 3 days back & needed to charge at-least thrice a day.
Though i just waiting couple of more days, as might due i have lot of backup downloading.
But usually battery consuming about 20% in 1 hr only while watching online.
Camera just Ok, but my previous Phone A7-2018 was having better camera."
829,25 June 2019,balakrishna,"Personally I'm a lover Samsung m40 mobile is awesome mobile 6gb ram 128gb rom in budget, screen was excellent, even other mobiles there is full screen mobile pop up camera this samsung think in a different way in display I'm happy with but a think was disturb when a voice play in screen speaker only in our speaker over good to me"
830,27 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"* Finger print sensor, read the finger print quickly.
* Rear camera was good.
* 3500 mah Battery gives better performance.
* Totally this is the best one from samsung in this segment under 20k."
831,28 September 2019,Amazon Customer,We have recieved a bent mobile. when we visited mobile shop for back cover that time a man said it is bent. We did not realise the bent position due to raised camera. Even the Samsung care person also said that it is bent. They showed us putting a mobile screen on plane surface.
832,10 October 2019,Aj Rockr,"wrost product ever
not even type c to 3.5 mm jack working with it and in box earphones material quality is too cheap
even this phone lags too much while playing pubg
the one thing this Phone got is only looks
back camera quality is good but for front camera i must say the images from front camera looks dusty 😩"
833,27 June 2019,Vikas Chobey,"All in All, the phone is a great value for money. The battery life is impressive. The Sound on Display tech will take some time to get used to. The Camera overall is good at this price point. However, the wide angle pictures tend to get blurry at the sides sometimes. The display though not AMOLED still has good viewing experience."
834,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Asad patel,"Handset very bad speaker problem, only 1 sim slot very bad handset quality Issue I Dont Like this Samsung m40 moblie"
835,26 June 2019,Nikhlesh Chaurasia,"Got m40 today.. awesome display ,very smooth and quick touch, very fast finger print , camera quality is very best, earpieces are like JBL I think better than JBL..go for its without 2nd thought ...and most important is that this is not Chinese.."

837,29 June 2019,Gaurav Chauhan,"After the recent purchase of my Samsung Galaxy M40, the first thing i loved to sea was the back panel. The design and color combination is so amazing. The screen quality, camera clearity and battery backup are all aweome. Really enjoying to use this amazing smartphone in the best price. Worth every penny invested in this phone."
838,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ravi Roget,No Optimization at all... Worst battery life.. Worst of all no Bixby... complete waste of money...
839,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Nihal,"Just got the delivery yesterday but the sim tray was not opening. I have asked for a return. Still got no confirmation from Amazon about the same. Haven’t used this much, so I cannot comment on the phone but surely the sim tray issue is a setback for Samsung phone lovers."

843,3 August 2019,Amit K.,"Rear camera quality is good. Front camera could have been better as compared to other samsung phones.
Fingerprint reader in not always fast. Most of the times it's slow.
Battery stands whole day."
844,19 July 2019,Pradeep Gattupalli,Everything is good except battery. Unlocking using fingerprint or face is better than China made phones. Made In India I believe
845,17 August 2019,Tanmay Hire,"lags, mediocre gaming performance, lack of sAMOLED visible, comes with corning gorilla3 when other devices are equipped with gorilla glass5. Stuttering and lag in apps within 2 weeks of use.
Battery life is less than a day and only 5 hrs when used for gaming/streaming. Camera quality average. This one is overpriced by at least 2,500RS."
846,20 July 2019,Samelraj D,"Battery back up camera and speed storage 128gb are awesome. Desigh also nice headphones and dolby atmos too good.

858,27 June 2019,balazubacs,"Only thing battery could've been 4000 or above. Because I was using continuously like gaming movies Facebook and watsapp. It is lasted me for 6.5 hours.

Camera quality ia good day light night camera is average
Quick capture doesn't take more time
Battery life is good enough
Bright full screen display looks good tough
Overall a good phone at good price range"
883,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amazon Customer,"Battery capacity is insufficient. Front camera is beyond bad. Its said that front camera is 16mp. But I think its false information. Maybe Samsung wanted to write 1.6 mp or max 6mp but wrote 16 mp by mistake. Also, have started facing range issues just when I started using this phone."
884,6 August 2019,tanuj,"very very very bad product from Samsung.
i suggest every one should buy a50 i stead of m40.
when you talk over phone whole sreen seems like vibrating.
camera quality is very poor
and hangs on continues use.
i suggest that no one should buy this phone except the full screen it has nothing."
885,29 July 2019,Nava Chaitanya,"Never go for this product and I received a faulty device and the technology Introduced in this product which is under screen speaker is really horrible. I suggest no to go for this model, who prefers for ear speaker. A big failure for Samsung"
886,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Vaibhav,Sansung has excelled once again in creating the worst phone yet. The in screen audio technology when on a call provides an unwanted and frustrating experience! One shouldnt go for this phone.
887,27 July 2019,Mukesh,"Worst mobile ever , everything is bad. Battery is bad , camera is bad . Plus little water will harm your device. I brought it 3 months back and now its useless , it is not working at all . Very bad product and service center guys asked me to pay 17000 for its service. This is how they loot the customers. Very bad samsung."
888,24 June 2019,Sanjeev,"Overall the phone is Nice, Touch is Excellent Camera Quality is not better than A series.
The Biggest Disappointment is the Voice(Audio) Quality it is scattered and Voice gets echoed when on speaker. Some Fix Need to be Provided pretty soon else you know is not BEST Buying option available in market today."
889,22 June 2019,Shalvi Saxena,Pretty good device yet heating issue is a downgrade. Handles games pretty well though HDR high graphics in pubg makes the game laggy. Also the in-screen mic function makes the phone vibrate a lot.
890,25 June 2019,Amazon Customer,Very poor performance.
891,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Harprit Vadhva,3 rd class Ear sound so much wrost in 20000 price .. After i call amazon cistmer care for refund prosece is very bed.. Plz do not buy..bcz ear speaker so much vibreat body..then we feel very bed..

Fingerprint sensor is placed too high, inconvenient.
Face unlock Is okay
Phone spéed is so so ok."
894,29 September 2019,Amazon Customer,Good mid range smart phone.. has all required features..can have a better battery design to withstand long duration like the one which was given for M30s model
895,26 June 2019,Rishi,Phone look is fine but proper handling is required if you are using it without back cover. Too scratchy. Battery performance is moderate. Amazon / Samsung should provide back plastic cover atleast as I waited for its availability in the market/site. Even now good covers are not available post 10 days of launch.
896,19 October 2019,Mr. Soham chirde,Samsung launched this all time best mobile phone. I think it is real a smart phone. Only one problem is that battery life is only 3500MAH that is only take in consideration. All the Games you want to play on any Graphics is too superb. I played PUBG & freefire on full Graphics and is unbelievable.
897,The manufacturer commented on the review below,CB Singh,"It's annoying. Waste of money. Camera is not at all good. I couldn't eject sim tray. Amazon delivered faulty device. Camera quality is really very bad. I didn't expect this from Samsung. Even I don't like this design too. After long struggle,
At least received refund for this. Better I'll go for A50 Redmi."
898,26 June 2019,Nakul Dange,"Samsung galaxy M40 has amazing display with full hd infinity -O display. Processor is strong so it works smoothly . Battery is 3500 MAH which is enough still 4000 would be better. Fingerprint scanner is not that good. It take time to unlock when device is sleeping.
Overall its a nice device I like it ."

901,21 July 2019,PRAVEEN,"Every thing is good in phone but only the battery life given it sucks battery,according to me now 5000mh is must in every android phone or say I smartphone so please in future find any solution that we can change the battery of the same cell phone or help us so the battery do not drain so fast..."
902,25 June 2019,Vikrant Sharma,"I got this product with tempered glass recommended on Amazon's website (Comoro).
The tempered glass doesn't fit & covers the front camera.
Samsung shouldn't release products if they cannot provide accessories.
Amazon shouldn't show false pictures if they do not have the right fits."
903,26 June 2019,Tejas patil,"Fingerprint reader and battery life is good or i would say amazing.
Just facing issue with camera quality , the ultra wide angle make me happy but the captured photos colour are not natural. It seems whitish... though I'm sure Samsung will give an update on it.

Excellent build quality,
Average battery life,
Good performance,

Screen sound technology is annoying, you wont be able to hear the other person in traffic or noisy areas, you may hear robotic voice. It might be a bad option for people with heavy calling usage."
906,13 September 2019,madhur aggarwal,"3rd class phone n bad customer practice of amazon to not to replace it with another model. Phone call voice not clear, bad camera n warms on charge."
907,21 June 2019,Anil,"Disappointed for not providing Amoled display and small battery capacity
No back cases and screen protectors are available in the market
Manufacturer should provide back case"

Battery is very very poor.
Front camera makes selfie artificial adding extra white tone."

915,2 July 2019,Amazon Customer,I'm comparing MOTO G6 and this Samasung M40. Look wise display very good. When comparing with MOTO G6 camera photo quality is very bad. I don't thing its worth to pay 20K instead of paying just 14K for Moto g6.
916,27 June 2019,Kishor,"Crisp display with responsive touch screen
Light weight very thin...very easy to handle because of thickness and width

I would say a 3star for this phone"
1003,4 August 2019,Jignesh Dhobi,"Camera quality is quite good. Phone features are limited, in this amount other companies are giving more features. Even scanner is not i nbuilt, no more sensors..so amount is high.
Battery is average.. fast charging is there but consumption also is fast.."
1004,24 June 2019,Amazon Customer,"Despite its battery capacity and lack of 3.5mm jack, everything else was more than awesome.
The phone is extremely good looking and speed is incredible. It is not only handling multiple tasks easily but also not getting over heat on over usage.
I love this phone"
1005,1 October 2019,Sreyasi,Very bad camera quality and speaker. No headphone jack present. Not good battery life. The fingerprint reader is so-so. Hyped price.

1021,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Genuine,"Main objective of the Mobile is to speak but the clarity is lacking in this model , not able to clearly hear the other person. I wish Amazon being the Launching partner for Samsung should help its customers to fix this critical issue.
Phone gets heated up just in few minutes"

Pls dont buy this product..."
1023,25 June 2019,Sarthak D.,The product is good. The only issue is the sound quality which you receive From the speaker of the phone but you can use the earphones you get to overcome that problem. It's a good mobile overall so I definitely say it's worth buying
1024,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Prasanna Parvathaneni,"One off worst phone ever by Samsung, 20k totally in drain.
Battery drains completely within 5hrs and this is on the 2nd day.
Has heating issues as well.
Camera quality is average. Selfie camera is poor.
Amazon service centre's response is extremely pathetic."
1025,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Amit Potnis,"Straight to the point:
1. Camera quality is below average.
2. Battery drains as its life has already expired.
3. Filled with OS bugs.
4., Sound quality of calls is also worst.
Even after reading this review if you buy this phone, you'll be a proud fool."
1026,14 September 2019,Vishwesh,The mobile phone is not that much good as it looks. The processing speed is little bit slow and finger prints doesn't work smoothly. The battery doesn't give that much backup. It exhausted early and quickly while using continuously.
1027,8 October 2019,Ankur Bansal,"Better life is normal..
One issue i.e.C type and no connecter avaliable in market and samsung store...
Rest are ok."
1028,16 July 2019,Ankit Patne,Look is good but fingerprint is worst. When mobile is look and we tao on scanner its not working. Then i have to press lock button then it will work. Battery performance is also not good. I will give 3 star out of 5. I am not satisfied with the product samsung M40.
1029,29 June 2019,Sanjay Singhal,"As per my review phone is good everything is good.
Design is good phone is less in weight and look are good.
The thing which are missed by the hand of samsung is pop up light. Charging and headphone port is same. The most I'm missing in this handset is pop up light."
1030,26 August 2019,Rithesh,"Battery life:

I'm not a gamer. I'll use phone just for calls,WhatsApp & sometimes for shopping apps.

If I start using phone with 100% battery. By Eod, it will be at 15% charge remaining. I have stopped auto sync on my mobile to extend the battery lif me."

1033,1 July 2019,Bharat saraswat,"Phone looks good but disappointed to see that there is no seperate slot for SD card. In case you are using 2 sim in the same phone then this phone is not for you.

1034,The manufacturer commented on the review below,PRADEEPTA NAYAK,"Call receive time speaker sounds quality not up to mark,"
1035,26 June 2019,Jithin Nair,The only cons are poor battery life and lack of a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Even with a tft display it does produce good colours .Gaming and running of apps are as smooth as it gets .The rear camera works fine . The front cam can over expose you a bit. A good phone nevertheless
1036,25 June 2019,mantosh,"Display is great. It's not amoled but the color reproduction is good.
The calling experience is something new with touch sound. It's good and will get better with update.

1041,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Ankit Pandey,Worst product...voice is not audiable during phone call and its camera quality is also very poor. Its also vibrate during phone call. Money wastage. Highly disappointed
1042,18 July 2019,Adhithyan,"I am using this for last 1 week

Really worth to buy.

People are thinking that there is no amoled display.

I have both A50 and M40 I dint feel any difference between TFT display and AMOLED display.

You can trust and buy this phone."
1043,18 August 2019,Atul Puri,"Phone is A bad buy as the basic feature of phone which is voice call is full of echos due to inbuilt earphone.
Also display is not good.
Better go for mi note 7 for 11500 rather than wasting your money.
Even amazon not ready to return the product."
1044,17 August 2019,ashish,Worst battery performance and takes more than 2 hours to charge 100%. Lag problem while gaming. (Adding one issue after use of one month - battery is of worst quality it gets charged from 90% to 100% within 1 second and drain to less than 90% again after 5 minutes of use).
1045,21 July 2019,DrNaveen Rk,"Exchanged my old device on prime day for 7.5k and got this.. initial experience seems smooth.. screen quality is amazing, camera is brilliant(both rear and selfie).. Only drawback was absence of separate slots for 2nd sim and micro SD card"
1046,19 July 2019,Amazon Customer,"After 10 days of use
Design is good
Too much heating problem
Front camera quality is bad

1048,14 October 2019,Abhijeet paul,Not so happy with this phone as there is some problem in charging point it is only point for headphones and charger
1049,19 July 2019,Amazon Customer,Phone is good but no other option for SD card if you have to use SD card then you have to remove 1 sim card & if you want to watch movie during charging period then you can't use Earphone because no any other option for earphone. You have to use earphone in Charging point
1050,5 September 2019,Amazon Customer,"Worst experience with Amazon and Samsung got defective product and not able to replace or return.
Facing multiple issues with phone battery drains very fast without using phone , heating issues , sometimes screen touch works automatically , blur pics from main camera"
1051,30 June 2019,TEJAS,"Phone is Good....Battery backup is also good.

9/10 would recommend"
1053,13 August 2019,Siva Aravind,"Fingerprint reader is not perfect
Camera quality in dark area is noisy
If you are heavy user you need to charge the phone thrice a day or keep the powerbank along with you

After two months
Camera has updated and stabilization is improved"
1054,29 July 2019,Lavanya,"I have been using this product from one week, the speaker quality is of low standard. The product can’t be replaced or return as the sound quality issues can’t be detected by the app they asked to install. Overall don’t waste your 20k bucks buying such an useless product"
1055,21 July 2019,S.R.IYER,Samsung M40 is amazing smartphone.packing is excellent.service provided is impeccable.one drawback is you have not provided the user manual as mentioned in your order.kindly provide the same along with the mobile cover for which a separate order is pending from your end.
1056,18 July 2019,Ruchir,Battery seems to be draining too fast. Not happy with battery performance. Hardly any usage on home WiFi and battery levels dropped fast. Gonna review in a couple days more else will have to return the phone

1058,15 July 2019,Bindu Makwana,"The only problem with the phone is that it has the speaker in the screen and not like other devices.
So we get the voice from under the screen.
Thats good technology and the voice quality is also good but it cant replace the traditional speaker voice."
1059,26 June 2019,suyog pashine,Display and camera are cool. Phone looks premium. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few but overall awesome. Fingerprint sensor working fast maybe you feel disappointment for face unlock. Camera quality is quite nice & good battery backup.
1060,30 June 2019,Shubham Jha,The processor is fast and smooth. No problem in playing games or multitasking. But the best thing about this mobile is its display. Binge watching experience is amazing. The only con I found is that battery may drain out on heavy usage
1061,28 June 2019,ARPIT RADADIA,"Great phone in this budget...good camara wuality,great fingerprint reader and ""Inscreen sound sound technology"" is a new thing in market.last one in ""scree camera""......wonderfully.....

1071,19 August 2019,Pradeep VM,Much more facilities than I expected for this price. Camera is wonderful. The bezel free front screen is an attraction that beats the apple variants of iPhone X which also I have. In terms of value for money M40 would beat the S series and Apple products.
1072,26 June 2019,sampath,"Very low sound display sound and vibarate, over heating, camera average."
1073,4 October 2019,RAKESH RAO,"Overall nice product. Smooth touchscreen, Finger print reader also responds well, very good rear camera. But not happy with front camera. Battery life also not very satisfactory. Overall good product. M30s looks to have better features though."

1087,11 September 2019,Chandan Kumar Rai,"I am writing this review after using the phone for 3 months.

Phone Not up to mark as per the price. While watching video you cannot attend call using head phone. You have unplug and then again plug in the head phone to connect call."
1088,The manufacturer commented on the review below,the sound is really good,"The phone compromises on the basic feature of a phone, poor call audio.
Bad audio from screen demeans all it's positive points."

1091,27 June 2019,Titus Clement,"Galaxy M40 is almost best. Comparitively bit poor perfomance with realme, oppo, redme.
Also it can be improved the fingerprint reader camera quality and ofcourse the battery life.
But it's worth for the price.
Overall it's best phone except the mentioned problems."
1092,9 July 2019,Suvojeet Mukherjee,I like the processing speed of the phone but they could have provided with a longer charging wire.. the headphone quality is good.. I like the face recognition unlocking of the phone.. hope u improve the quality in much better way

1094,15 August 2019,Shiva Kumar Angamuthu,"Everything is fine for this price range, except for battery. Though battery is controlled by usage and auto brightness adjust, 4000 mha would have been better. I'm a normal user and never play high end games, end up charging end of the day."
1095,25 June 2019,Bhoomi dwivedi,This product is very cool and impressive but the only issue with this product is its sound when u call someone it becomes very irritating and hectic because u r not able to hear properly that is a very major issue with this product

1099,28 June 2019,Vaibhav,"It is the best phone I have used by far. The quality of sound is nice while playing video, the camera quality and features are nice. Overall it's a nice phone to have."
1100,2 September 2019,Amazon Customer,Incoming audio is not clear..informed customer care executive. But they are less concerned...says once bought this product cannot be exchanged....seeing such reckless executives for First time on Amazon....Seems Amazon standards are coming down......
1101,23 June 2019,Vikas,I like this cell phone because as it is very lovely feel in my hand as it is slim and its infinity o display is amazing but front camera is also too good but ok charging is very fast but another 3.5 jack should be in this phone including type-C port

1275,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Prem Anand,Very worst mobile. Voice of this phone is echoing with vibration .Amazon has not accepted to replace this mobile. Legally case will be filed with relevant recording of conversation with the customer service .Dont buy this mobile.
1276,29 June 2019,MATURU NAVEEN KUMAR,Look was really nice with full display. And about the mobile when we use games like pubg it's lagging and mobile was getting heated.And rest of else like opening applications and fingerprint lock very nice and works very fast.

1278,28 June 2019,Teril,The phone is quite smooth with a lot of cool features especially the punch hole display. However it doesn't have a praiseworthy camera. The Seawater blue coloured is very pretty and much nicer to look at than the Midnight version.

1280,19 July 2019,Tripathy,"Incoming voice is not clear.. some vibrating noise is there, plz rectify or replace the mobile, now one more issue is there."
1281,8 August 2019,Amazon Customer,All looks fine the only problem is the camera image processing is bit odd buy Samsung should improve that in teh next update. Battery capacity is bit small compared to other phones in this price segment but it can last for a day.

1286,22 August 2019,kamalesh kumar dwivedi,Battery quality is not so good. It must be more than provided. Sometimes fingerprint reader doesn't work so good. If we exclude battery and fingerprint reader phone quality in this price segment is awesome. I can give 4 out of 5.

1312,9 September 2019,Ankit,The fingerprint reader doesn’t recognise the finger at times when placed at some angles where already all angles are registered while setup. Also the face recognition is slow and doesn’t recognise face in low light conditions.
1313,16 July 2019,Jatin kashyap,It is a good product and battery life is little bit less but it's ok camera quality is excellent and inbuilt ringer is very amazing which means ultra sound processor is very amazing all things are good and touch is very smooth

1330,2 August 2019,YahyeaBL,Single port for both charging and earphones make it difficult to play games like pubg while charging. Display becomes irresponsive even if it comes in contact with little sweat. Camera is fabulous. Best phone in this budget.
